HOWTO: Translate and run X10 programs on the command line and with eclipse:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

What you need:

 - install a Java SDK and eclipse.
 - obtain the latest version of the X10 prototype code from 
   CVS (update in Eclipse)
 - set the JAVA_HOME environment variable such that it points to the 
   Java installation that you want to use to translate and run x10 
   programs. The 'java' and 'javac' command shall be found at 
   $JAVA_HOME/bin/ (Unix style).
 - set the X10_PLATFORM environment variable according to your platform.
   Currently this corresponds to the subdirectory under examples/lib where
   native libraries are kept.  For 32-bit Windows on x86 hardware,
   the string is win32_x86.  For AIX on PowerPC it is aix_ppc.
   The naming convention is <OperatingSystem>"_"<Hardware>, consistent
   with Eclipses ${system:OS} and ${system:ARCH} variables.
 - run the build.xml ant script in the root directory of the x10
   installation.  
   o if you call ant from within eclipse, then specify the 
     following tragets explicitly (in this order): bin, base, jl, x10-ext.
   o if you call ant form the command line the default target (i.e., all)
     is fine.
   This should create the files bin/x10, bin/x10c and
   etc/standard.cfg. (see note below).
 - add the bin directory of the x10 installation to your system's
   search path


Procedure:

 To translate and run the X10 examples from the command line:
 Note: This only works with cygwin: You have to build the scripts 
       x10 and x10c with ant/cygwin and also run those scripts within 
       cygwin!

 - cd x10/examples/Constructs/Future
 - x10c Future1Boxed.x10 (this will create .java files and translate
   them with javac to class files)
 - x10 Future1Boxed (will start the x10 runtime and run that program).


 To translate and run the X10 examples from eclipse:

 - right-click on the example to be translated:
 - choose "Run" from menu
   - main class: ployglot.main.Main
   - program arguments: -ext x10 ${resource_name}
   - VM args: -Djava.library.path=${project_loc}/examples/lib/${system:OS}_${system:ARCH}
   - working directory: ${container_loc}

 - right-click on the example to be executed:
 - choose "Run" from menu
   - main class: x10.lang.Runtime
   - program arguments: ${resource_name}
   - classpath - User Entries - Advanced: add variable string 
     ${container_loc}
   - click OK
