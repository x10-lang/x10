INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS
-------------------------

For successful installation and subsequent usage, the following hardware and
software requirements should be met:

Machine: Power5
OS: AIX ver 5.3
Switch: Federation/HPS
Software:
[Both Runtime and Development]
	BOS (Base Operating System) ver 5.3.0.40 (including Pthreads)
	POE (Parallel Operating Environment) ver 4.2.2.4
	RSCT (Reliable Scalable Cluster Technology)/LAPI ver 2.4.2.6
	IBM XL C/C++ Compiler ver 8.0.0.0
	LoadLeveler ver 3.3.2.4


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------

After downloading the package to a temporary working directory, you can unzip
and untar it using the following command:

	$ cd ${TMP_WORK}

	$ gzip -d -c libx10-0.6_aix5.3_ppc.tar.gz | tar -x -v -f - 

Once this is done, libx10-0.5 directory will be created in the current
working directory and all the distribution files can be located under it.

	$ cd libx10-0.6

Run the provided install script 'install.sh' with a PREFIX pointing to
the top directory with respect to which all the other subdirectories
and files will get installed during the process.  The top directory
also becomes the X10LIB_HOME for subsequent library usage.

If PREFIX is not specified, then your home directory will become
the X10LIB_HOME and the entire installation will be done with respect to
your home directory.

	$ PREFIX=${PATH_TO_X10LIB_HOME} ./install.sh


INSTALLED COMPONENTS
--------------------

A successful execution of the above step will lead to the following files
in various subdirectories for regular usage:

${PATH_TO_X10LIB_HOME}/

		bin/x10libcxx
		bin/x10libcc
		include/*.h
		lib/libx10.a
		share/X10Lib/RELEASE.NOTES
		share/X10Lib/INSTALL
		share/X10Lib/epl-v10.html
		share/X10Lib/examples/
		share/X10Lib/examples/Makefile
		share/X10Lib/examples/*.c
		share/X10Lib/examples/*.cc
		share/X10Lib/examples/*.sh
		share/X10Lib/hostfiles/
		share/X10Lib/hostfiles/*.list
		share/X10Lib/doc/
		share/X10Lib/doc/usage.txt
		share/X10Lib/doc/api.txt
		share/X10Lib/doc/x10lib-design.pdf
		share/X10Lib/install.log

Currently, there is no uninstall script available for uninstalling the
installed files.  You can refer to the 'install.log' file that is created
during installation and manually remove the files and directories were
created during this process.
