you need to modify two Makefiles appropriately to compile on moixe and altair.

First you need to go to simple-4.4G/src/Makefile.var, choose line 86 or 87 according to the platform.

You will also need to set the correct PROCTYPE on line 8 in spanT/Makefile.smp.mk 

You need to make simple first , and then spanT.

go to simple-4.4G; gmake
go to spanT; gmake
