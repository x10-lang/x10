<h1>Macintosh X10 Command Line Installation on Leopard</h1>
In order to run X10 on OS X Leopard, you need to satisfy the following pre-requisites.
<h2>Prereqs</h2>
<ul>
	<li>gcc/g++ 4.0.x or higher</li>
	<li>java 1.5.0_x or higher</li>
	<li>Open MPI 1.2.x or higher</li>
</ul>
Fortunately, Mac OS X Leopard provides most of these as part of its environment. Although
you may have to download the development environment called Xcode to get the compiler tools.

<h3>gcc/g++</h3>
gcc is included with OS X. You can verify the location and version
with the following commands

<pre>
whereis gcc
gcc -v
</pre>

You should see something similar to this

<pre>
$ whereis gcc
/usr/bin/gcc
</pre>

<pre>
$ gcc -v
Using builtin specs.
Target i686-apple-darwin9
Configured with: ....
Thread model: posix
gcc version 4.0.1 (Apple Inc. build 5493)
</pre>

If you do not get these results, you will have to install Apple's
Developer Tools called Xcode.  There are 2 ways to do this
<p>
1) There should be a version on your installation disk for Leopard.
You should insert your disk and go the the "Optional Installs" folder.
There you will see a "Xcode Tools" folder. When you select this folder,
you will see the "XcodeTools.mpkg" package installer. You should double
click on this and follow the instructions to install the Xcode tools.
You should let this install to the default folder "Developer". When the
installation is complete, check the installation as described above.
<p> 
2) You can download Xcode from Apple's Developer Connection (ADC) site. 
<a href="https://connect.apple.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/MemberSite.woa/303/wo/3K14hrg1ACiF2P18GAizqThJ6TZ/0.0">Developer Connection Member Site</a> 
This method insures that you will get the latest Xcode version whereas 
method 1 may be an earlier version available at the time of packaging the
Leopard installation DVD.
<P>
To access this site, you may have to signup for an ADC id. Once you are
logged into the member site, you should select the "Downloads" area
and then select "Developer Tools" on the right hand side from the Downloads area. 
You should scroll until you find "Xcode 3.1.4 Developer Tools"
which is the version for Leopard. You should note that "Xcode 3.2.1 Developer Tools"
is the version for Snow Leopard. 
<p>
Once you have downloaded the Xcode Disk Image, you can invoke the package installer.
You should let this install to the default folder "Developer". When the
installation is complete, check the installation as described above.

<p>
Actually Xcode Tools comes with 2 versions of the gcc compiler, 
4.0 and 4.2.  Leopard defaults to 4.0.
If you go to the /usr/bin directory, you can
see how the gcc and g++ commands are linked.

<pre>
$ cd /usr/bin
$ ls -al g*
</pre>

You should see something like this
<pre>
g++ -> g++-4.0
g++-4.0
g++-4.2
gatherheaderdoc
gcc -> gcc-4.0
gcc-4.0
gcc-4.2
gcov -> gcov-4.0
gcov-4.0
gcov-4.2
</pre>

If you want to switch to the 4.2 compiler, you just need to change the
links (g++, gcc, gcov, C++) to point to the 4.2 versions. You should also
change the links under Developer directory where Xcode was installed to be
consistent.
<p>
Also, Xcode 3.1.3 on Leopard points gcc and g++ by default at the 4.0 compiler 
(Xcode includes both 4.0 and 4.2), so you’ll have to change the links:

<pre>
  % su -
  $ cd /usr/bin
  $ rm gcc cc g++ c++ gcov
  $ ln -s gcc-4.2 gcc
  $ ln -s gcc-4.2 cc
  $ ln -s g++-4.2 g++
  $ ln -s c++-4.2 c++
  $ ln -s gcov-4.2 gcov
  $
</pre>
<p>
There’s an identical set of links in /Developer/usr/bin that you should probably 
also change (for safety and consistency’s sake).

<p>
You will need to do this in order to build the x10 distribution which
will be discussed in another chapter.

<h4>java</h4>
Java is also included with the OS X. You can verify the location and version
with the following commands
<pre>
whereis java
java -version</li>
</pre>

You should see something like this

<pre>
$ whereis java
/usr/bin/java
</pre>

<pre>
$ java -version
java version "1.5.0_20"
Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.5.0_20-b02-315)
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.5.0_20-141, mixed mode, sharing)
</pre>

If you go to the /usr/bin directory, you can see that the java command
is a link.

<pre>
$ cd /usr/bin
$ ls -al java
</pre>

You should see something like this
<pre>
java -> /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/Current/Commands/java
</pre>

Actually OS X ships with multiple versions of java
under
/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions
If you are up to date with patches, you will also find java 1.6 here.
If you want to switch to java 1.6, you can change the links to "Current" and
"CurrentJDK" in the JavaVM.framworks versions directory.  See chapter XX.

<h4>Open MPI</h4>
OpenMPI is also included with OS X. You can verify the location and version
with the following commands
<pre>
whereis mpirun
mpirun -version</li>
</pre>

You should see something similar to this

<pre>
$ whereis mpirun
/usr/bin/mpirun
</pre>

<pre>
$ mpirun -version
mpirun (Open MPI) 1.2.3
</pre>
