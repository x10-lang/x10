8</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Summary and future work</h2>

     <h3><a name="tth_sEc8.1">
8.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Design for scalability</h3>
X10 is designed for scalability, by encouraging working with local data,
and limiting the ability of events at one place to delay those at another. For
example, an activity may atomically access only multiple locations in the
current place. Unconditional atomic blocks are dynamically guaranteed to be
non-blocking, and may be implemented using non-blocking techniques that avoid
mutual exclusion bottlenecks. 
Data-flow synchronization permits point-to-point
coordination between reader/writer activities, obviating the need for
barrier-based or lock-based synchronization in many cases.

8.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Design for productivity</h3>
X10 is designed for productivity.

<b>Safety and correctness.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Programs written in X10 are guaranteed to be statically
<em>type safe</em>, <em>memory safe</em> and <em>pointer safe</em>. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Static type safety guarantees that every location contains only values whose
dynamic type agrees with the location's static type. The compiler allows a
choice of how to handle method calls. In strict mode, method calls are
statically checked to be permitted by the static types of operands. In lax
mode, dynamic checks are inserted when calls may or may not be correct,
providing weaker static correctness guarantees but more programming
convenience. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Memory safety guarantees that an object may only access memory within its
representation, and other objects it has a reference to. X10 does not
permit 
pointer arithmetic, and bound-checks array accesses dynamically if necessary.
X10 uses garbage collection to collect objects no longer referenced by any
activity. X10 guarantees that no object can retain a reference to an
object whose memory has been reclaimed. Further, X10 guarantees that every
location is initialized at run time before it is read, and every value read
from a word of memory has previously been written into that word.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Because places are reflected in the type system, static type safety
also implies <em>place safety</em>. All operations that need to be performed
locally are, in fact, performed locally.  All data which is declared to be
stored locally are, in fact, stored locally.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
X10 programs that use only clocks and unconditional atomic
blocks are guaranteed not to deadlock. Unconditional atomic blocks
are non-blocking, hence cannot introduce deadlocks.
Many concurrent programs can be shown to be determinate (hence
race-free) statically.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<b>Integration.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
A key issue for any new programming language is how well it can be
integrated with existing (external) languages, system environments,
libraries and tools.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We believe that X10, like Java, will be able to support a large
number of libraries and tools. An area where we expect future versions
of X10 to improve on Java like languages is <em>native
integration</em> (&#167;). Specifically, X10 will permit
permit multi-dimensional local arrays to be operated on natively by
native code.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc8.3">
8.3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion</h3>
X10 is considerably higher-level than thread-based languages in
that it supports dynamically spawning lightweight activities, the
use of atomic operations for mutual exclusion, and the use of clocks
for repeated quiescence detection.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Yet it is much more concrete than languages like HPF in that it forces
the programmer to explicitly deal with distribution of data
objects. In this the language reflects the designers' belief that
issues of locality and distribution cannot be hidden from the
programmer of high-performance code in high-end computing.  A
performance model that distinguishes between computation and
communication must be made explicit and transparent.<a href="#tthFtNtAAC" name="tthFrefAAC"><sup>2</sup></a>
At the same time we believe that the place-based type system and
support for generic programming will allow the X10 programmer to
be highly productive; many of the tedious details of
distribution-specific code can be handled in a generic fashion.

<a name="tthFtNtAAB"></a><a href="#tthFrefAAB"><sup>1</sup></a>The class is officially declared
abstract to allow for multiple implementations, like sparse and band matrices,
but in fact is abstract to avoid having to write the actual definitions of
<b>+</b> and <b>*</b>.

X10 is similar to more modern languages such as ZPL [].
