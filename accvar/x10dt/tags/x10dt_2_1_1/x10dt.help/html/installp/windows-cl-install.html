<h1>Windows X10 Command Line Installation</h1>
In order to run X10 on Windows, you need to satisfy the follow pre-requisites.
<h2>Prereqs</h2>
<ul>
	<li>gcc/g++ 4.2.x or higher</li>
	<li>java 1.5.0_x or higher</li>
	<li>mpich2 2-1.2.1</li>
</ul>

<a name="gcc-prereq">
<h3>gcc/g++</h3>
gcc is not installed with Windows. To get gcc you will need to install the Cygwin package.
The latest version is 1.7.7. There are two ways to do this
<ol>
<li>script installation using the cygwin-install package documented 
under <a href="#batch-cygwin">the batch installation</a> 
<li>interactively using the cygwin installer which is documented 
under <a href="#interactive-cygwin">the interactive installation</a> 
</ol>

<a name="batch-cygwin">
<h4>1. Cygwin batch installation</h5>
We have developed a batch installation of Cygwin that you can downloaded
to install the Cygwin environment.  It can be downloaded from 
<a href="http://dist.codehaus.org/x10/documentation/install/cygwin-install.zip">
http://dist.codehaus.org/x10/documentation/install/cygwin-install.zip</a>
<p>
You should download this file to a temporary directory, unzip the contents, and
run "cygsetup.bat".   This will prompt you for your windows id so it can create
the login directory and install some cygwin shell files. Also watch out for any
firewall prompts that you may have to respond to.
<p>
Once the installation is complete you should double check that the Windows PATH
environment variable has been updated to include the following directories:
<ul>
<li>C:\cygwin\bin</li>
<li>C:\cygwin\usr\contrib\mpich2-1.2.1\bin</li>
</ul>
<p>
Once the installation is complete you will be in the cygwin directory, and you
can start cygwin by running "cygwin.bat".  Then you should run "mpd &". 
MPD is the MPICH daemon, which controls/runs/stops the proccesses on your machine.
<p>
We have also supplied another batch file called "addpkg.bat" which can be used
to download additional packages.  For example, you might want to download and 
install the unix editors, vim and emacs.  You would do this by running
<pre>
addpkg vim emacs
</pre>
<p>
For those who are interested in compiling the X10 distribution,
we have also supplied another batch file called "addbuildpkgs.bat" which will
download all the packages you need to build the x10 distribution.
<p>
You can now proceed to checking the <a href="#java-prereq">java prereq.</a>


<a name="interactive-cygwin">
<h4>2. Cygwin interactive installation</h5>
To get the base cygwin do the following
<ul>
<li>Go to the cygwin site
  http://www.cygwin.com/
<li>Click on install or update
  The latest Cygwin release is 1.7.1-1
<li>Save the setup file to a local folder, e.g. cygwinInstall
<li>Execute setup.exe
  Allow any firewall rules, if needed
<li>Click next
<li>select download source, click next
<li>select root install directory, usually C:\cygwin, click next
<li>select local package directory, usually c:\cygwin, click next
<li>select your internet connection, usually Direct connection, click next
<li>select a download site, usually one closest to you, click next
<li>click ok on any setup alerts
<li>select the packages, usually the defaults to begin with, click next
<li>select icons, click Finish
</ul>

<p>
Once the default packages have completed installing, you can start cygwin by
doing the following.
<pre>
cd c:\cygwin
cygwin.bat
</pre>
You should see the skeleton files being created for your userid.  The userid is
created from your windows id.

<p>
Once cygwin is working, you should relaunch setup and select the gcc/g++ compiler that
is required by X10. Note any dependencies will be downloaded also.
<pre>
Devel - 4.3.4-3 - gcc4-g++ G++ subpackage
</pre>

<p>
Select any other packages that you may want. Note any dependencies will be downloaded also.
<pre>
Utils - util-linux 2.14.1
</pre>

<a name="java-prereq">
<h3>java</h3>
Java is not included by default with Windows. However, nost people will have installed one already.
If not, you should download and install the latest Sun Java runtime or JDK for 1.5.0_x or 1.6.0_x.
You should install Java in the normal fashion either in "Program Files" or directly at the
root level. Usually you would make this installation your system JVM.
<p>
Cygwin should recognize that you have java installed and use it. The only thing that you should
do is make sure that JAVA_HOME is defined in your environment variables for X10 to use.
You can do this using the Windows control panel System application.
<pre>
Control Panel -> System -> Advanced -> Environment Variables
</pre>
Under System variables, check for JAVA_HOME and if not defined, click edit and enter the 
"Variable name" JAVA_HOME and the "Variable value" as the JRE or JDK path. Click Ok to save
your values.
<p>
You should start cygwin and test for Java by doing the following
<pre>
which java
java -version
echo $JAVA_HOME
</pre>
You should see something like this
<pre>
$ which java
/cygdrive/c/WINDOWS/System32/java

$ java -version
java version "1.5.0_11"
Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.5.0_11-b03)
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.5.0_11-b03, mixed mode)

$ echo $JAVA_HOME
C:\jdk1.5.0_15
</pre>

<a name="openmpi-prereq">
<h3>openmpi / mpich2</h3>
OpenMPI is not include with Windows.
We have created a version of MPICH2 for Windows on the codehaus site that should be downloaded
and installed in the cygwin directory.
<p>
<a name="batch-mpich">
<h5>MPICH batch install</h5>
If you have used the batch installation of cygwin, you can bypass the next section
and proceed to <a href="#getting-started">getting started</a> section.
<p>
<a name="interactive-mpich">
<h5>MPICH interactive install</h5>
Start the cygwin setup again and add this as a Cygwin mirror.
You'll have to run Cygwin setup with -X (command line, or through a shortcut) 
to make it avoid checking signatures.
<pre>
http://dist.codehaus.org/x10/x10dt/2.0/cygwin/
</pre>
If you do not ignore signatures, you will get this error:
<pre>
Unable to get http://dist.codehaus.org/x10/x10dt/2.0/cygwin/setup.ini.sig from 
<http://dist.codehaus.org/x10/x10dt/2.0/cygwin>
</pre>
The following package should be selected
<pre>
Base - 1.2.1-2 - mpich2: A high performance...
</pre>
Click next to install.
</p>
After it is installed you will find mpirun and other commands in
/usr/contrib/mpich2-1.1.1p1/bin
<p>
If you see the following error using mpirun
<pre>
cd /usr/contrib/mpich2-1.1.1p1/bin
./mpirun
/usr/bin/env: python2.5: No such file or directory
</pre>
you need to restart the cygwin setup, select your mirror, and make sure the following package is installed.
<pre>
Python - 2.5.5-1 - python: Python language interpreter
</pre>

<p>
Then you should modify your .bash_profile file to contain this directory in the PATH
<pre>
.bash_profile
PATH=/usr/contrib/mpich2-1.2.1/bin:${PATH}
export PATH
</pre>

<a name="getting-started">
<h2>Getting started</h2>
You need to download the X10 2.1 distributions for your platform,
<pre>
AIX/Power
Linux/Power (SLES11)
Cygwin/x86
Linux/x86 (RHEL5)
Linux/x86_64 (RHEL5)
MacOS/x86 and x86_64
</pre>
in this case Windows Cygwin/x86. The Common PGAS runtime is inlcuded in the download.
Go to the <a href="http://x10.codehaus.org/X10+2.1.0+Release">X10 release 2.1 (http://x10.codehaus.org/X10+2.1.0+Release)</a> and download
the X10 distribution.  You should save this file in the same location as the cygwin installation directories.
You should check periodically for new releases at http://x10.codehaus.org/X10+Releases.
<p>
Next you need to install the X10 distribution so that it is available to use.  My recommendation is to
make a directory in the /usr/local or /opt tree.  To do this do the following. Note that you may have to use
the "sudo" command to get access.

Start the cygwin bash shell.
<pre>
cd /usr
mkdir local
cd local
mkdir x10
cd x10
mkdir 2.1
</pre>

Make all of these directories accessible by everyone
<pre>
cd /usr
chmod -R 755 local
</pre>

Now copy the x10 download to x10dist directory and unpack it.
<pre>
cp /cygdrive/c/cygwinInstall/x10-2.1.0_cygwin_x86.gz /usr/local/x10/2.1
</pre>
and then unpack the x10 distribution.
<pre>
cd /usr
cd local
cd x10
cd 2.1
gunzip x10-2.1.0_cygwin_x86.gz
tar -xvf x10-2.1.0_cygwin_x86
</pre>

<p>
Now you are ready to setup your environment that makes use of these directories.
On Cygwin running the bash shell, it is probably better to modify .bash_profile to add the x10 bin directory
to your path.  You can also define aliases here, etc.  You will also need to add the x10 lib directory so the
system knows how to find the cyggc-1.dll file.
<p>
Here is a sample .bash_profile
<pre>
.bash_profile
PATH=/usr/local/x10/2.1/bin:/usr/local/x10/2.1/lib:$PATH
export PATH
</pre>

<p>
Once the installation is complete you should update the Windows PATH
environment variable  to include the following directories:
<ul>
<li>C:\cygwin\bin</li>
<li>C:\cygwin\usr\contrib\mpich2-1.2.1\bin</li>
</ul>

Now you will be able to use the x10 commands to compile and run your programs.
My recommendation is to make an x10 directory or an x10work directory in your
home path, and create a directory for each project.
<p>
To get started we will copy the HelloWorld program from the x10 samples directory into your
working directory
<pre>
cd ~
mkdir x10
cd x10
mkdir HelloWorld
cd HelloWorld
cp /usr/local/x10/2.1/samples/HelloWorld.x10 .
</pre>
<h4>java backend</h4>
To compile the this program with the java backend you would enter
<pre>
x10c HelloWorld.x10	
</pre>
You should now see some java classes in your directory.
<pre>
HelloWorld$1.class		HelloWorld$Main.class	HelloWorld.x10
HelloWorld$Main$1.class	HelloWorld.class
HelloWorld$Main$2.class HelloWorld.java
</pre>
You can now run this program by entering
<pre>
x10 HelloWorld
</pre>
You should see
<pre>
Hello World!
</pre>

<h4>C++ backend</h4>
To compile the this program with the c++ backend you would enter
<pre>
x10c++ -MAIN_CLASS=HelloWorld HelloWorld.x10	
</pre>
The reason for using the -MAIN_CLASS is so that the compiler generates a
runtime called "HelloWorld". If you leave off the -MAIN_CLASS directive, 
your output will be under a.exe .
<p>
You should now see a .cc and .inc file in your directory.  
<pre>
HelloWorld.cc	HelloWorld.exe HelloWorld.h	HelloWorld.inc	HelloWorld.x10
</pre>
<p>
You can now run this program by entering
<pre>
runx10 HelloWorld.exe
</pre>
You should see
<pre>
Hello World!
</pre>
<p>
Note that the C++ backend makes use of the MPICH2 runtime that is installed on your
system, so you can also enter the following command to run an x10 program
<p>
<pre>
mpirun -np 1 ./HelloWorld.exe
</pre>
<p>
However, on Windows, a daemon (mpd) has to be running to use mpirun. This daemon requires a
.mpd.conf file in your home directory. You can create this by doing the following
<pre>
cd $HOME
touch .mpd.conf
chmod 600 .mpd.conf

...and then use an editor to insert a line like

  MPD_SECRETWORD=mr45-j9z
  
Of course use some other secret word than mr45-j9z.

</pre>
<p>
Now you can start the mpd daemon in the background so you can use mpirun to execute programs. 
<p>
<pre>
mpd&
</pre>
<p>
You will need to prefix your program
with a "./" so that mpirun knows to look in the current directory for the program. You
can fix this by adding "./" to your PATH directive in your profile.
<p>
Now you should be able to use mpirun to schedule programs.

<p>
If you see this error, it means that you have not started the daemon
<pre>
mpiexec_IBM_575BEBB7377: cannot connect to local mpd (/tmp/mpd2.console_infos5);
  posssible causes:
  1. no mpd is running on this host
  2. an mpd is running but was started without a "console" (-n option)
In case 1, you can start an mpd on this host with:
     mpd&
and you will be able to run jobs just on this host.
For more details on starting mpds on a set of hosts, se
the MPICH2 installation guide.
</pre>

<p>
If you get this error when starting the mpd daemon, you have not created the .mpd.conf
file in your home directory.
<pre>
A file named .mpd.conf file must be present in the user's home
directory (/etc/mpd.conf if root) with read and write access
only for the user, and must contain a least one line with:
MPD_SECRETWORD=<secretword>
One way to safely create this file is to do the following:
  cd $HOME
  touch .mpd.conf
  chmod 600 .mpd.conf
and then use an editor to insert a line like
  MPD_SECRETWORD=mr45-j9z
into the file. (Of course use some other secret word than mr45-j9z.)
</pre>

<p>
At this point, you may want to compile the other sample programs from the "samples"
directory.  Then you can begin creating your own programs.

<h4>Running x10 programs in more than 1 place</h4>
<ul>
<li>
To run the compiled X10 executable in one place, invoke
<pre>
    bin/runx10 ./&lt;class_name&gt;
</pre>
<li>
To run in multiple places on Linux, run "bin/manager", and then invoke 
<pre>
    bin/launcher -t &lt;nplaces&gt; ./&lt;class_name&gt;
</pre>
<p>
The basic idea is the following.
<ol>
<li>Make a hostlist.txt containing A and B on separate lines
	<ul>
	<li> A
	<li> B
	</ul>
<li>In one window/console/xterm run the command manager hostlist.txt
<li>In a different window/console do: launcher -t 2 HelloWholeWorld
</ol>
<p>
It helps a lot to have passwordless ssh working between the machine
where the manager process is running and the compute nodes.
<p>
When you do (3) you should see some output in the manager window
telling you that jobs are starting stopping.
</p>
<li>
To run in multiple places on AIX, run
<pre>
  "LAPI_USE_SHMEM=yes poe ./&lt;class_name&gt; -procs &lt;nplaces&gt; -hostfile HOSTFILE".
</pre>
  See "man poe" for additional options and the format of HOSTFILE.
<br><br>
<li>
If you have mpi available, you can use mpirun to run in multiple places.
  Details will vary depending on the exact syntax of the mpirun command,
  but something like this should work:
<pre>  
  mpirun -hostfile &lt;hosts&gt; -n &lt;nplaces&gt; ./&lt;class_name&gt;
</pre>
</ul>

<h4>Compiler options</h4>
Use "x10c -- -help" to get more detailed help on compiler options.
<pre>
$ x10c -- -help
$ x10c -- -help

<h4>Possible errors</h4>
<p>
If you see an error like this
<pre>
	0; xlupc transport: can't get network address associated with 	listner socket: Device not configured
	Abort trap
</pre>
This means that your ip address is being used by another program and the pgas library cannot
access the ip address using gethostbyname(). Check your /etc/hostconfig file does not contain
a HOSTNAME and /etc/hosts is configured properly.

<p>
If you see this error
<pre>
JAVA_HOME (C:/Program Files/IBM/Java60) is not pointing to a JRE or a JDK
</pre>
It means that you have to define a JAVA_HOME environment variable for X10. You should
refer to the java prereq section above to define this.

<h4>Make your own commands</h4>
You might want to make your own scripts or aliases so that you don't have to remember the exact
syntax. If you create scripts make sure that they are excutable.  If you place them in ~/bin
then you should add this to your PATH in your .bash_profile. You might also want to add
"./" to the beginning of your PATH statement so it will look first in the directory that you are in.
