 <h2><a name="tth_sEc1">
1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello!</h2>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Enough suspense! You knew it was coming, so let's get right to it!

<pre>
1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//&nbsp;file&nbsp;HelloWorld.x10
2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public&nbsp;class&nbsp;HelloWorld&nbsp;{
3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public&nbsp;static&nbsp;def&nbsp;main(args:&nbsp;Array[String](1)):&nbsp;Void&nbsp;{
4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x10.io.Console.OUT.println("Hello,&nbsp;World");
5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}&nbsp;

</pre>
Let's step through the program, a line at a time:

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<dl compact="compact">
 <dt><b>line 1:</b></dt>
	<dd> <tt>// file HelloWorld.x10 </tt><br />
Comments in X10 are the same as Java or C++: they either begin
with "<tt>//</tt>" and go through the end of the line, or begin with "<tt>/*</tt>"
and end at the <em>first</em> "<tt>*/</tt>" that follows.  Because the first "<tt>*/</tt>" 
ends the comment, "<tt>/*...*/</tt>" <em>comments do not nest</em>. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
X10 also uses the same 
comment conventions as JavaDoc for publishing APIs.  For those not familiar with JavaDoc,
it is a formalized comment style used to generate an HTML site that describes the API 
presented by a set of source code files-originally <tt>.java</tt> files,  and for us, <tt>.x10</tt> files. 
All of our sample code uses JavaDoc conventions.  <a href="#tthFtNtAAB" name="tthFrefAAB"><sup>1</sup></a> The version of the JavaDoc processor needed for our files is called X10Doc.</dd>
 <dt><b>line 2:</b></dt>
	<dd> <tt>class HelloWorld {... }</tt><br />
Like Java (and unlike C++) <em>all</em> X10 executable code lives in classes.
Normally a class will have the same name as its file- <tt>HelloWorld</tt> is found in
 <tt>HelloWorld.x10</tt>.</dd>
 <dt><b>line 3:</b></dt>
	<dd> <tt>public static def main(argv: Array[String](1))</tt><br />
Program execution starts, as in Java and C++,  with a method named
 <tt>main</tt>, which takes the command-line arguments as a collection of strings.
 But here we start to see some differences from Java and C++:

<ul>
<li> The keyword <tt>def</tt> begins a method declaration.   
This makes it easy to tell what's a method and what isn't.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> You don't usually need to specify the return type for a methods. The compiler
will discover the return statements in a method and will then normally be able
to deduce the return type.  
If you <em>do</em> wish to specify it, then, unlike Java and C++,
it <em>follows</em> the argument list.
The return type for <tt>main</tt> is <tt>Void</tt>, meaning that it does <em>not</em> return
a value.  The compiler can easily tell that without your help.  Note
the `<tt>:</tt>' that separates the argument list from the return type: it is required.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So why did we put the "<tt>:Void</tt>" there if we didn't have to?
Basically, just to save someone  other than us who is reading the code the trouble of
figuring out what's returned.  Keep in mind, too, that things are not always so
simple as our <tt>main</tt>: the compiler will patiently read the method body, but
do you want to force your human audience to do so?
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> X10 has generic types, along the same general lines as Java and C++. 
X10 uses square brackets to hold the actual type, <em>e.g.</em> <tt>Array[String]</tt>
for declaring an array of <tt>String</tt>s.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> X10 arrays, like FORTRAN arrays, may be multi-dimensional.  The "<tt>(1)</tt>" that
follows <tt>Array[String]</tt> asserts that the array is one-dimensional, or in other words,
is just like the usual Java or C++ array.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> The general syntax for assigning a type to an identifier is 

<center><tt><em>identifier</em>: <em>type</em></tt>,</center>
as in <tt>argv:Array[String](1)</tt>.  White space before or after the `<tt>:</tt>' is 
ignored by the compiler. In fact, white space in X10 is treated as it
is in Java and C++: normally ignored, except to the extent that it is needed to
separate tokens or appears in string literal constants.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>
</ul></dd>
 <dt><b>line 4:</b></dt>
	<dd><tt>x10.io.Console.OUT.println("Hello, World");</tt><br />
X10's libraries are arranged in packages, much like those of Java. 
The <tt>x10.io</tt> package contains many input-output classes. 

<blockquote><tt>Console.IN</tt>,  <tt>Console.OUT</tt>, and  <tt>Console.ERR</tt></blockquote>
are the standard input, output, and error streams. 
The method  <tt>println</tt> prints a string, followed by an operating-system dependent line-ender: either a
single newline character for Unix based systems, or a carriage return-newline pair.
If you don't want the newline, use <tt>print</tt> instead.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We'll give some more details about packaging in chapter .</dd>
</dl>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You can compile and run the Hello,World program as follows:

<pre>
%&nbsp;x10c&nbsp;HelloWorld.x10
%&nbsp;x10&nbsp;HelloWorld
Hello,&nbsp;World

</pre> 
This uses a Java-based runtime to execute the program.  There is also a C++
runtime.  To use it, compile with <tt>x10c++</tt> rather than <tt>x10c</tt>:

<pre>
%&nbsp;x10c++&nbsp;HelloWorld.x10&nbsp;-o&nbsp;hello
%&nbsp;runx10&nbsp;hello
Hello,&nbsp;World

</pre> 
You'll need the <tt>runx10</tt>: you cannot invoke <tt>hello</tt> directly, because some special
setup is required to accommodate the concurrency and the possible distribution of the
execution across multiple machines.  We don't actually need anything special here, but the
code for booting an X10 program is generic.
