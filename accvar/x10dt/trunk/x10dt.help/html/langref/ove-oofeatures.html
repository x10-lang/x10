1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Object-oriented features</h2>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The sequential core of X10 is a <em>container-based</em> object-oriented language
similar to Java and C++, and more recent language such as Scala.  
Programmers write X10 code by defining containers for data and behavior called
<em>interfaces</em>
(&#167;),
<em>classes</em>
(&#167;) and
<em>structs</em>
(&#167;).
X10 provides inheritance and subtyping in fairly traditional ways. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<b>Normed</b> describes entities with a <b>norm()</b> method. <b>Normed</b> is
intended to be used for entities with a position in some coordinate system,
and <b>norm()</b> gives the distance between the entity and the origin. A
<b>Slider</b> is an object which can be moved around on a line; a
<b>PlanePoint</b> is a fixed position in a plane. Both <b>Slider</b>s and
<b>PlanePoint</b>s have a sensible <b>norm()</b> method, and implement
<b>Normed</b>.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<pre>
interface Normed {
  def norm():Double;
}
class Slider implements Normed {
  var x : Double = 0;
  public def norm() = Math.abs(x);
  public def move(dx:Double) { x += dx; }
}
struct PlanePoint implements Normed {
  val x : Double, y:Double;
  public def this(x:Double, y:Double) {
    this.x = x; this.y = y;
  }
  public def norm() = Math.sqrt(x*x+y*y);
}
</pre>


<div class="p"><!----></div>

<b>Interfaces&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
An X10 interface specifies a collection of abstract methods; <b>Normed</b>
specifies just <b>norm()</b>. Classes and
structs can be specified to <em>implement</em> interfaces, as <b>Slider</b> and
<b>PlanePoint</b> implement <b>Normed</b>, and, when they do so, must provide
all the methods that the interface demands.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Interfaces are
purely abstract. Every value of type <b>Normed</b> must be an instance of some
class like <b>Slider</b> or some struct like <b>PlanePoint</b> which implements
<b>Normed</b>; no value can be <b>Normed</b> and nothing else. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<b>Classes and Structs&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There are two kinds of concrete containers: <em>classes</em>
(&#167;) and <em>structs</em> (&#167;). Concrete
containers hold data in <em>fields</em>, and give concrete implementations of
methods, as <b>Slider</b> and <b>PlainPoint</b> above.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Classes are organized in a single-inheritance tree: a class may have only a
single parent class, though it may implement many interfaces and have many
subclasses. Classes may have mutable fields, as <b>Slider</b> does.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In contrast, structs are headerless values, lacking the internal organs
which give objects their intricate behavior.  This makes them less powerful
than objects (<em>e.g.</em>, structs cannot inherit methods, though objects can), but also
cheaper (<em>e.g.</em>, they can be inlined, and they require less space than objects).  
Structs are immutable, though their fields may be immutably set to objects
which are themselves mutable.  They behave like objects in all ways consistent
with these limitations; <em>e.g.</em>, while they cannot <em>inherit</em> methods, they can
have them - as <b>PlanePoint</b> does.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
X10 has no primitive classes per se. However, the standard library
<b>x10.lang</b> supplies structs and objects <b>Boolean</b>, <b>Byte</b>,
<b>Short</b>, <b>Char</b>, <b>Int</b>, <b>Long</b>, <b>Float</b>, <b>Double</b>,
<b>Complex</b> and <b>String</b>. The user may defined additional arithmetic
structs using the facilities of the language.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<b>Functions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
X10 provides functions (&#167;) to allow code to be used
as values.  Functions are first-class data: they can be stored in lists,
passed between activities, and so on.  <b>square</b>, below, is a function
which squares an <b>Int</b>.  <b>of4</b> takes an <b>Int</b>-to-<b>Int</b>
function and applies it to the number <b>4</b>.  So, <b>fourSquared</b> computes
<b>of4(square)</b>, which is <b>square(4)</b>, which is 16, in a fairly
complicated way.
<pre>
  val square = (i:Int) =&#62; i*i;
  val of4 = (f: (Int)=&#62;Int) =&#62; f(4);
  val fourSquared = of4(square);
</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
They are used extensively in X10
programs.  For example, the normal way to construct an <b>Array[Int](1)</b> -
that is, a fixed-length array of numbers, like an <b>int[]</b> in Java - is to
pass two arguments to a factory method: the first argument being the length of
the array, and the second being a function which computes the initial value of
the <b>i</b><sup>th</sup> element.  The following code constructs a 1-dimensional
array 
initialized to the squares of 0,1,...,9: <b>r(0) == 0</b>, <b>r(5)==25</b>, etc. 
<pre>
  val r : Array[Int](1) = new Array[Int](10, square);
</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<b>Constrained Types&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
X10 containers may declare <em>properties</em>, which are fields bound immutably
at the creation of the container.  The static analysis system understands
properties, and can work with them logically.   

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For example, an implementation of matrices <b>Mat</b> might have the numbers of
rows and columns as properties.  A little bit of care in definitions allows
the definition of a <b>+</b> operation that works on matrices of the same
shape, and <b>*</b> that works on matrices with appropriately matching shapes.
<pre>
abstract class Mat(rows:Int, cols:Int) {
 static type Mat(r:Int, c:Int) = Mat{rows==r&amp;&amp;cols==c};
 abstract operator this + (y:Mat(this.rows,this.cols))
                 :Mat(this.rows, this.cols);
 abstract operator this * (y:Mat) {this.cols == y.rows} 
                 :Mat(this.rows, y.cols);
</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The following code typechecks, but an attempt to compute <b>axb1 + bxc</b> or
<b>bxc * axb1</b> would result in a compile-time type error:
<pre>
  static def example(a:Int, b:Int, c:Int) {
    val axb1 : Mat(a,b) = makeMat(a,b);
    val axb2 : Mat(a,b) = makeMat(a,b);
    val bxc  : Mat(b,c) = makeMat(b,c);
    val axc  : Mat(a,c) = (axb1 +axb2) * bxc;
  }

<div class="p"><!----></div>
</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The "little bit of care" shows off many of the features of constrained
types.    
The <b>(rows:Int, cols:Int)</b> in the class definition declares two
properties, <b>rows</b> and <b>cols</b>.<a href="#tthFtNtAAB" name="tthFrefAAB"><sup>1</sup></a>  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
A constrained type looks like <b>Mat{rows==r &amp;&amp; cols==c}</b>: a type
name, followed by a Boolean expression in braces.  
The <b>type</b> declaration on the second line makes
<b>Mat(r,c)</b> be a synonym for <b>Mat{rows==r &amp;&amp; cols==c}</b>,
allowing for compact types in many places.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Functions can return constrained types.  
The <b>makeMat(r,c)</b> method returns a <b>Mat(r,c)</b> - a matrix whose shape
is given by the arguments to the method.    In
particular, constructors can have constrained return types to provide specific
information about the constructed values.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The arguments of methods can have type constraints as well.  The 
<b>operator this +</b> line lets <b>A+B</b> add two matrices.  The type of the
second argument <b>y</b> is constrained to have the same number of rows and
columns as the first argument <b>this</b>. Attempts to add mismatched matrices
will be flagged as type errors at compilation.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
At times it is more convenient to put the constraint on the method as a whole,
as seen in the <b>operator this *</b> line. Unlike for <b>+</b>, there is no
need to constrain both dimensions; we simply need to check that the columns of
the left factor match the rows of the right. This constraint is written in
<b>{...}</b> after the argument list.  The shape of the result is computed from
the shapes of the arguments.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And that is all that is necessary for a user-defined class of matrices to have
shape-checking for matrix addition and multiplication.  The <b>example</b>
method compiles under those definitions.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<b>Generic types&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Containers may have type parameters, permitting the definition of
<em>generic types</em>.  Type parameters may be instantiated by any X10 type.  It
is thus possible to make a list of integers <b>List[Int]</b>, a list of
non-zero integers <b>List[Int{self != 0}]</b>, or a list of people
<b>List[Person]</b>.  In the definition of <b>List</b>, <b>T</b> is a type
parameter; it can be instantiated with any type.
<pre>
class List[T] {
    var head: T;
    var tail: List[T];
    def this(h: T, t: List[T]) { head = h; tail = t; }
    def add(x: T) {
        if (this.tail == null)
            this.tail = new List(x, null);
        else
            this.tail.add(x);
    }
}
</pre>
The constructor (<b>def this</b>) initializes the fields of the new object.
The <b>add</b> method appends an element to the list.
<b>List</b> is a generic type.  When  instances of <b>List</b> are
allocated, the type parameter <b>T</b> must be bound to a concrete
type.  <b>List[Int]</b> is the type of lists of element type
<b>Int</b>, <b>List[List[String]]</b> is the type of lists whose elements are
themselves lists of string, and so on.
