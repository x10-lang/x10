<h2><a name="faq1">Conservative build compiler option:<a></h2>
<p>
There is a new compiler option "Conservative Build", which is turned on by default. 
When turned on, this option causes each file that has no generated code in a project 
to be re-submitted for compilation on every build. This ensures that all the files 
that need to be recompiled are indeed compiled when the user saves in an editor, 
and overcomes some shortcomings of the compiler which make it difficult to compute 
dependencies between files. However, this feature is overly conservative, 
an causes the builder to be slower. To make builds faster, this option may be turned off. 
In this case, the user may occasionally observe stale compilation errors. 
This of course can be easily remedied by doing a clean every now and then.

<h2><a name="faq2">Memory usage issues:<a></h2>
<p>

It is best to work only with a few (< 5) editors open at any time, 
because otherwise X10DT becomes very slow.
Due to memory leaks (which we are currently fixing for the next release), 
the system becomes unresponsive after some time (~30mns of usage). 
It is best to restart Eclipse regularly, in order to avoid running out of memory. 
Unfortunately when this happens in eclipse, the workspace could become unusable 
due to corruption of meta-data (or there may be odd behavior). 
So it's best to restart Eclipse regularly and frequently in order to avoid this situation. 
We are working to fix these issues for the next release.

<h2><a name="faq3">I installed just the X10DT and the CDT "New C/C++ Project" wizard dies. Why?<a></h2>
<p>
   Answer: The X10DT uses PTP, which in turn requires just a part of the CDT as a prerequisite. Due to a problem with the way the CDT is packaged, the wizard appears in the CDT's menus, but the wizard's implementation is not actually available. To fix this problem, you need to install the CDT (see below).
</p>

<h2><a name="faq4">How can I use both the X10DT and the CDT in the same Eclipse install?<a></h2>
<p>
   Answer: Install the CDT first from any of the usual Eclipse update/discovery sites, and then install the X10DT.
</p>

<h2><a name="faq5">How can I change the font in the X10DT editor?<a></h2>
<p>
   Answer: You can change it in the Preferences in the following page.
	General > Appearance > Colors and Fonts.
	Then under Basic folder, click on Text Font and then click the Edit button.
</p>

<h2><a name="faq6">Memory consumption<a></h2>
<p>
   Answer: Memory consumption by the editor and the build process has been improved since previous releases. It is still a work in 
progress. You may encounter either two memory-related errors:
<ul>
  <li>Java Heap Space OutOfMemory: You can increase the maximum heap size by specifying the -Xmx (Sun VM) VM option in the eclipse.ini
  in your Eclipse installation. For more details, see the Eclipse online help.</li>
  <li>Java PermGen OutOfMemory: You can increase the PermGen area's size by specifying the -XX:MaxPermSize (Sun VM) in the
  eclipse.ini file.</li>
</ul> 

Additionally, it may be useful to reduce the number of simultaneously opened editors.
</p>

<h2><a name="faq7">Builder performance<a></h2>
<p>
   Answer: The current build mechanism is somewhat conservative in determining the set of files to be recompiled upon each save.
This will cause longer build times under certain circumstances.</p>
<p>We've provided a building option, "Conservative Build" - turned on by default, which if turned off (see <a href="../html/x10dt/prefs.html#compiler">X10 Preferences</a>) can result in shorter 
build times. However the shorter build time comes at the expense of incorrect behavior for certain X10 source programs.
