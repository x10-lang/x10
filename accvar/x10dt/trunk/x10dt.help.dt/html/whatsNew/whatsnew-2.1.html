    <td class="section_item">Project Back-End Conversion</td> 
    <td class="section_content">
      When one creates an X10 project with a given back-end, 
      <p><img src="images/projectBackendConversion.png"/></p>
      there is now an opportunity to convert the project to another back-end by right-clicking on the project 
      and selecting "Configure > Convert to X10 Project with ...".
      <p><img src="images/projectBackendConversion2.png"/></p>
      Such conversion is available in both directions for the two back-ends currently supported by the X10 compiler.

    <td class="section_item">Source editors</td> 
    <td class="section_content">
	You can now open source editors on the X10 runtime source code. There are two ways to do this:
	<ol>
	<li>In the Package Explorer, open up the X10 Runtime Container, and double-click on one of the X10 source files.</li>
    <li>Hyperlink (or invoke "Open Declaration" in the editor's context menu) from a reference to an X10 Runtime type or 
    member to its declaration in the X10 Runtime source code.</li>
 	</ol>
    Please note that when you do this, the editor that comes up will not have all of the usual IDE services enabled. A fix for this issue will be in the next release.   
    </td>

  <tr> 
    <td class="section_item">Auto-indentation</td> 
    <td class="section_content">
     Several bugs in the auto-indentation support in the source editor have been fixed, 
     and indentation should now behave as expected.
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr> 
    <td class="section_item">Correct indentation</td> 
    <td class="section_content">
      You can now re-indent the current text selection in the source editor by invoking 
      "Correct Indentation" from the "Source" menu in either the main menu bar or 
      the editor's context menu.
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr> 
    <td class="section_item">Source menu</td> 
    <td class="section_content">
      The X10DT now provides a "Source" menu in both the main menu and the editor context menu, 
      with several common menu items: "Correct Indentation", "Shift Left/Right", and "Toggle Comment". 
    </td>

  <tr> 
    <td class="section_item">Entity information (F2)</td> 
    <td class="section_content">
       You can now hit F2 in the source editor to pop up a window showing information on the entity at the text caret. 
       If there are compiler messages at that site, these will be displayed in the pop-up view; 
       otherwise, information about the entity's declaration will be shown.

    <tr> 
    <td class="section_item">Quick Fix Support</td> 
    <td class="section_content">
       <p>Quick fix support has been added to the editor.</p>
       <p> 
      When an error has a quick fix available, a lightbulb icon appears in the ruler instead of the standard error icon.
      When hovering over the error in the editor available quick fixes will appear in the tooltip:
      </p>
      <p><img src="images/quickfix_hover.png" alt="Hover"></img></p>
      <p>
    	Quick fix can also be invoked by right clicking the lightbulb icon in the ruler and selecting the "Quick Fix" action:
      </p>
      <p><img src="images/quickfix_context.png" alt="Context Menu"></img></p>
      <p>When quick fix is invoked in this way the available quick fixes show up similar to content assist:</p>

  <tr> 
    <td class="section_item">Quick Type Hierarchy</td> 
    <td class="section_content">
      <p>A quick type hierarchy view is now available within the editor</p>
      <p>  
      It can be invoked by pressing Ctrl+T within the editor, and will show a type hierarchy based upon what is selected within the editor.
      When first invoked it will show a tree containing sub types:
      </p>
    <p><img src="images/quickhierarchy_subtype.png" alt="Sub Type"></img></p>
    <p>
    Pressing Ctrl+T once the view is visible, allows you to toggle between the sub type and super type views:
    </p>
    <p><img src="images/quickhierarchy_supertype.png" alt="Sub Type"></img></p>
    <p>
    Typing in the text box perfoms a filter on the tree:
    </p>
    <p><img src="images/quickhierarchy_filter.png" alt="Sub Type"></img></p>
    <p>
    Selecting an item in the tree will open an editor on that type.

    <tr> 
    <td class="section_item">Open Type Dialog</td> 
    <td class="section_content">
    <p>
       An Open Type dialog can be invoked within the X10 perspective by pressing Ctrl+Shift+T.
    	Typing in the filter will show all types which match the text typed.  
    	Selecting 1 or more items and clicking 'OK' will open editors on the selections.

  <tr> 
    <td class="section_item">Disable editor features preference</td> 
    <td class="section_content">
    <p>
      Because of performance issues with the X10 compiler front-end, we've added a preference 
      to improve editor performance when working on large source files. When this preference 
      is turned on, certain editor features like hyperlinking and hover help are effectively 
      disabled, by bypassing the more expensive front-end processing phases like name resolution 
      and type-checking. This will also effectively disable some of the content assist. 
      Basic editor functionality, such as syntax highlighting, source code folding, and 
      outlining continue to function as usual. Likewise, all non-editor functionality, 
      such as building and launching, will also behave normally in this mode.

    </td>
  </tr>
  
    <tr> 
    <td class="section_item">Full Source Editor Functionality Now Provided for "External" Files</td> 
    <td class="section_content">
    <p>
     When editing files that live outside the workspace, or that live within non-X10 workspace 
     projects, the source editor now uses a search path derived from the location of the source 
     file and the package declaration in that file, if any. It also adds the location of the X10 
     runtime that is provided with the X10DT. As a result, the X10DT is able to resolve references 
     to entities in "nearby" X10 source files, as well as X10 runtime entities. This enables nearly 
     the full range of editor and navigation functionality (hover help, hyperlinking, content assist, 
     and so on). Notably, the mechanism also works when editing the "X10 runtime in X10" (the "XRX") 
     as a source project. Please note, however, that build and launch functionality still requires 
     a proper X10 project, as created by the "New X10 Project" wizard.
