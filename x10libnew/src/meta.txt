Notes.

-- Consider unifying switch and clock. Optimize later, if necessary.

-- finish is handled through switches as follows. The user must create a switch for the finish. Each
   activity spawned between the start finish and stop finish must use this switch. The user's code must
   follow the convention that whenever an activity A spawns a new activity B, then B is spawned with the
   switch (if any) on which A was spawned. This convention is to be followed even if the activity is to
   be spawned remotely. Now a stop finish is implemented by simply waiting on the switch.
 
 -- Need put's that perform atomic rmw operations on the remote side.
 
 -- Are sticky switches needed?
 
 -- Need global operations on arrays: e.g. reduce.

-- Note: Global memory allocation is subsumed under the creation of arrays.
