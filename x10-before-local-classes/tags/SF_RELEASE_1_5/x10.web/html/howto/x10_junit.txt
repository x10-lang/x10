HOWTO: Add a new testcase to the X1- development environment.
------------------------------------------------------------

JUnit testing harness for the X10 compiler.
File: x10/src/polyglot/ext/x10/tests/TestCompiler.java.

 
Overview
--------
 The harness helps invoke the compiler on an X10 testcase and
 then tries to execute the resulting code in the JVM.
 The X10 code can either consist of a 'run' method (which
 is supposed to return 'false' on errors) or of a 
 'main' method (which is supposed to throw an exception on
 errors).
 Naturally, if the compiler gives an exception, this is also
 an error.
 

Adding tests
------------
 Adding testcases is typically a one-liner: add a testXXX
 method which calls run or runMain, passing the path to the
 X10 source and the name of the main class as arguments.
 For the main case, you can also pass the arguments to the
 main method of the X10 program (if any).  So most of the
 work is to write the x10 code that does something interesting.
 
 If you are addding new tests that are currently known to fail,
 please <em>commit</em> them with a capital "T" in the "test" of the
 method name.  This deactivates the test, allowing others to
 quickly check that they did not break anything when running
 the tests in regression.  
 
Running the tests
-----------------

 Running this testcase is easy, add it as just any JUnit
 test to eclipse.  You might want to make sure to have the
 current working directory set to the root of the X10
 checkout (x10/), otherwise the data/ files (xcds) and
 the X10 source inputs will not be found by the compiler.
 
 If you are not using eclipse, compile the code using
 "ant x10-ext" and then run "bin/junit" (both from the main
 x10 directory).  [ Note that this currently does not work,
 it fails in the same way as x10c does, Vj said he'd look
 into this, so I won't. ]
 
Internals
----------

 The harness works by using a class loader to load the
 dumped .class files and some reflection to invoke the
 testcase.  Some setup work is done to initialize the X10
 Runtime.
