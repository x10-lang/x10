9</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Summary and future work</h2>

     <h3><a name="tth_sEc9.1">
9.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Design for scalability</h3>
 X10 is designed for scalability. An activity may atomically
access only multiple locations in the current place. Unconditional
atomic blocks are statically guaranteed to be non-blocking, and may
be implemented using non-blocking techniques that avoid mutual
exclusion bottlenecks. Dataflow synchronization permits point-to-point
coordination between reader/writer activities, obviating the need for
barrier-based or lock-based synchronization in many cases.

     <h3><a name="tth_sEc9.2">
9.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Design for productivity</h3>
 X10 is designed for productivity. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<b>Safety and correctness.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b> 
Programs written in  X10 are guaranteed to be statically <em>type
safe</em>, <em>memory safe</em> and <em>pointer safe</em>. Static type safety
guarantees that at runtime a location contains only those values who's
dynamic type satisfies the constraints imposed by the location's
static type and every runtime operation performed on the value in a
location is permitted by the static type of the location.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Memory safety guarantees that an object may only access memory within
its representation, and other objects it has a reference to.  X10
supports no pointer arithmetic, and bound-checks array accesses
dynamically if necessary.  X10 uses dynamic garbage collection to
collect objects no longer referenced by the computation.  X10
guarantees that no object can retain a reference to an object
whose memory has been reclaimed.  Further,  X10 guarantees that
every location is initialized at runtime before it is read, 
and every value read from a location has previously been written into
that location. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Pointer safety guarantees that a null pointer exception cannot be
thrown by an operation on a value of a non-nullable type.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Because places are reflected in the type system, static type safety
also implies <em>place safety</em>: a location may contain references to only
those objects whose location satisfies the restrictions of the static
place type of the location.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 X10 programs that use only clocks and unconditional atomic
blocks are guaranteed not to deadlock. Unconditional atomic blocks
are non-blocking, hence cannot introduce deadlocks (assuming the
implementation is correct).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Many concurrent programs can be shown to be determinate (hence
race-free) statically.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<b>Integration.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
A key issue for any new programming language is how well it can be
integrated with existing (external) languages, system environments,
libraries and tools.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We believe that  X10, like  Java, will be able to support a large
number of libraries and tools. An area where we expect future versions
of  X10 to improve on  Java like languages is <em>native
integration</em> (&#167;&nbsp;). Specifically,  X10 will permit
permit multi-dimensional local arrays to be operated on natively by
native code.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

     <h3><a name="tth_sEc9.3">
9.3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion</h3>
 X10 is considerably higher-level than thread-based languages in
that it supports dynamically spawning very lightweight activities, the
use of atomic operations for mutual exclusion, and the use of clocks
for repeated quiescence detection.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Yet it is much more concrete than languages like HPF in that it forces
the programmer to explicitly deal with distribution of data
objects. In this the language reflects the designers' belief that
issues of locality and distribution cannot be hidden from the
programmer of high-performance code in high-end computing.  A
performance model that distinguishes between computation and
communication must be made explicit and transparent.<a href="#tthFtNtAAB" name="tthFrefAAB"><sup>1</sup></a>
At the same time we believe that the place-based type system and
support for generic programming will allow the  X10 programmer to
be highly productive; many of the tedious details of
distribution-specific code can be handled in a generic fashion.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We expect the next version of the language to be significantly
informed by experience in implementing and using the language. We
expect it to have constructs to support continuous program
optimization, and allow the programmer to provide guidance on
clustering places to (hardware) nodes. For instance, we may introduce
a notion of hierarchical clustering of places.
