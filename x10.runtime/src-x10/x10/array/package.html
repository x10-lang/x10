<p>Provides an implementation of simple (dense, rectangular, zero-based) 
   single place and distributed arrays. </p>

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

<p>This package provides an implementation of simple (dense, rectangular, zero-based) 
   single place and distributed arrays and supporting abstractions such as
   iteration spaces. The goal of this package is to provide a high-performance
   implementation of this fairly restricted, but commonly used array abstraction.</p>

<p>In the X10 2.4 release, this package is still under development. We
   expect that the API for single-place arrays (Array and its
   subclasses; IterationSpace and its subclasses) is fairly close to
   the final API. The code for DistArray and its subclasses is less
   well-developed and therefore more likely to change significantly in
   future releases.  We also expect to add a wider variety of
   DistArray implementations in future releases.</p>
