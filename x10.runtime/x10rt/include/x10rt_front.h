/** @mainpage X10RT API Specification
 *
 * @section intro Introduction
 *
 * X10RT is a C library (implemented in C++) that a compiled X10 program uses to communicate between
 * places.  It can also be used by other languages or applications, if they have sufficiently
 * similar semantics.  It also should be possible for third parties to reimplement certain X10RT
 * components on top of new networking layers and HPC systems.  This allows the running of X10
 * programs in those environments.  The API documentation discusses what the X10 process needs from
 * this layer in terms of semantics and performance.
 *
 * @subsection goals Technical Goals
 *
 * @li define a minimal set of network operations fundamentally needed by X10
 *
 * @li represent only the communication elements of the X10 implementation
 *
 * @li abstract from details of the X10 object model, serialisation, remote references, etc.
 *
 * @li allow highly scaled X10 configurations (e.g. 250000 places) 
 *
 * @li avoid forcing implementations to introduce latency/bandwidth overhead 
 *
 * @li allow implementations to use hardware accelerated memory copies (where appropriate)
 *
 * @subsection launch Configuration and Launch
 *
 * The X10RT implementation defines the application launch process, e.g., requiring the use of
 * mpirun. The configuration of the system (i.e. number of places) should be controlled by the
 * end-user of the X10 program. Determining the identity of a particular X10 process in the
 * execution is the responsibility of the X10RT implementation. When executing X10 processes, the
 * standard C entry point (int main) should be invoked as normal.  The application should then
 * explicitly initialize and finalize X10RT like any other library.
 * 
 * @subsection places Places
 *
 * An X10 program runs on more than one place.  These places consist firstly of hosts (e.g. x86 /
 * PPC machines, or some mixture of the above), on a network such as Ethernet, Infiniband, etc.
 * However there are also accelerator places that are children of these hosts.  Thus the topology of
 * places is a 2 level tree where all the hosts are equals on the network, and under each host are
 * optionally some accelerator cards.  Currently the accelerators are CUDA-capable GPUs only.  We
 * have plans for OpenCL places and there is some incomplete code for supporting QS21 blades.  Note
 * that in the current implementation, there is no distinction between hosts and processes.
 *
 * @subsection messages Messages 
 * 
 * During the execution of an X10 program, messages are exchanged between places. Messages have a
 * type/length/value format, where the type is a number in the range 0-65535. Messages are
 * registered by the X10 program but X10RT chooses the message type values that identify messages.
 * Messages can have arbitrary size, and two messages with the same type need not be the same size.
 * In all cases, individual messages may be re-ordered but delivery must be guaranteed.
 *
 * There are three types of messages:  'Plain' messages carry data that has been specially packed
 * into a buffer (allocated by the caller), and invoke a callback on the remote side to handle the
 * message.  'Put' messages additionally carry large amount of data that is transmitted directly
 * from a given existing datastructure, and have callbacks on the remote side to locate a home for
 * the data as well as to indicate that the transfer is complete.  'Get' messages cause data to be
 * retrieved from a place directly into the given datastructure, and have a callback on the remote
 * side to locate the source of the data and a callback on the destination to indicate that the
 * transfer is complete.  In X10, plain messages are used to implement asyncs whereas put/get
 * messages are used to implement the copyTo/copyFrom functionality.
 *
 * All of these messages cause callbacks to be invoked on the far side, so can be considered
 * 'active'.  They all carry a packed buffer of serialised data.  There is therefore a lot of
 * overlap in functionality.  Note that if the amount of data is small or is not in a contiguous
 * form, or if the data formatting (endian, alignment, etc.) is not the same between the two hosts,
 * it is appropriate to use the 'plain' messages.  If the data is in a contiguous form, the
 * allocation and packing overhead of using a big packed buffer can be avoided by using the get/put
 * messages.  Note that the get/put messages still require a packed buffer, but it would in this
 * case only be used for metadata and thus the overhead would be negligible.
 *
 * @subsection structure Library Structure
 *
 * The X10RT library has various modules for implementing specific behavior.  The highest level API
 * is accessed via the functions in x10rt_front.h.  X10 and other languages should usually target
 * the x10rt_front.h API.  There is an auxiliary header x10rt_types.h that defines some common types
 * for the whole system.  More low level than x10rt_front.h there is the Logical Layer, found in
 * x10rt_logical.h, which deals only with communication.  The goal of the Logical Layer to join
 * together the various backend networking libraries presenting a uniform set of places.  It exports
 * functions that allow communication to and from these places no matter where they are found in the
 * topology.
 *
 * Underneath the Logical Layer are the networking layers.  There is a Core Networking Layer
 * x10rt_net.h which provides the links between hosts.  There are currently many implementations of
 * the core networking layer:  There is a standalone implementation that allows multiple places via
 * inter-process communication on a single host.  There is an MPI implementation that uses MPI for
 * communication between hosts.  There is a sockets implementation that uses TCP/IP sockets. All
 * of these implement the symbols in x10rt_net.h so they cannot currently be used simultaneously.
 * However one can link against whichever implementation is preferred for inter-host communication.
 * Details on the available implementations of the Core Networking Layer can be found <a
 * href=http://x10-lang.org/documentation/practical-x10-programming/x10rt-implementations.html>here</a>.
 *
 * In addition to the Core Networking Layer x10rt_net.h there is a layer for CUDA, which is intended
 * to wrap the NVidia CUDA API in a way that provides an interface that is very similar to
 * x10rt_net.h.  This is found in x10rt_cuda.h.  Similarly if there were completed Cell / OpenCL
 * layers, these would be separate interfaces x10rt_cell.h and x10rt_opencl.h defining their own
 * distinct symbols.  It is the job of the Logical Layer to take the Core Networking Layer and allow
 * crosstalk between this and the various accelerator places by connecting these distinct APIs
 * together and dispatching messages accordingly.
 *

 * 
 *
 * @subsection callbacks Callbacks
 *
 * The X10RT API makes heavy use of callbacks at all levels for handling of incoming messages and
 * other events.  These callbacks are fully re-entrant.  This means they can call back into X10RT in
 * arbitrary recursive ways.  This is necessary because in X10 everything is an async and thus
 * asyncs are capable of executing arbitrary code, including sending other asyncs and waiting for
 * remote termination.  These callbacks can execute for as long as they need to but if they become
 * idle for whatever reason, they should not block or busy wait.  They should call #x10rt_probe() to
 * trigger more callbacks.
 *
 * @subsection performance Performance Notes
 *
 * The x10rt_send_* functions may block until some internal operation has completed, such as writing
 * to a network buffer. But blocking until the callback has completed at the other side of the
 * transmission is not allowed as it may cause deadlocks to emerge within the X10 program.
 *
 * The X10RT implementation is permitted to handle messages (i.e. behave as if #x10rt_probe() has
 * been called) when it is called via one of the x10rt_send_* calls. This relaxation may be useful
 * for increasing throughput.
 *
 * The #x10rt_probe() function should not block waiting for network traffic to arrive, as to do so
 * would impact performance.  In the event of incomplete arrival of a message, #x10rt_probe() should
 * return, and the full receipt and associated action should be deferred to some future call of
 * #x10rt_probe() (which may be from another thread), i.e. to a time when sufficient data is
 * available to allow the immediate handling of the message.
*/

/** \name Initialization functions
 *
 * The execution has two phases.  The first phase is single threaded and is used to initialize the
 * X10 process.  No messages are sent in this phase.  The phase begins with #x10rt_init and ends
 * with #x10rt_registration_complete.  The second phase is the execution of the actual X10 program,
 * during which communication occurs.  This phase is multi-threaded and the X10RT library may be
 * called from multiple threads simultaneously.  The second phase ends with the #x10rt_finalize
 * function.

 * the implementation of X10RT on MPI.
 *
 * Also, the X10RT_ACCELS environment variable is used to decide how to configure accelerators at
 * the particular host.  The value of this variable is a string containing a comma separated list of
 * accelerators to use.  Each accelerator is specified as a string containing the kind of
 * accelerator, currently only CUDA, and the index of the particular piece of
 * hardware.  For example "CUDA0,CUDA0,CUDA1" will configure the host to use the first CUDA
 * device twice (two separate places on the same piece of hardware, as well as a 3rd place on the

/** \name Collective Operations
 *
 * These functions are designed to be called simultaneously by all members of a team.  The team is
 * created in advance, and can be globally identified using the value of the x10rt_team type that
 * was returned when the team was created.  During a collective operation, each participant
 * identifies itself using the 'role' parameter of the call.  The team itself is given too, as
 * multiple teams can be active at once.  Each role exists at a particular place, as defined when
 * the team was created, but there can be more than 1 role at each place.  Teams can be created with
 * #x10rt_team_new and #x10rt_team_split.  When a team is no-longer needed, each member should call
 * #x10rt_team_del to free its resources.
 *
 * The special team '0' is the 'world' team, i.e. it consists of a single role at each place, in
 * ascending order.  This team can always be used and should not be deleted.
 *
 * All of these calls are non-blocking.  This means that they may only block due to contention for
 * local resources, and not due to e.g. the tardiness of message receipt / processing at a remote
 * place.  Each call has 2 parameters indicating a callback that will be called when the operation
 * is completed, and a user parameter that will be passed to the callback.
 *
 * For convenience, there is a function #x10rt_one_setter that assumes its argument is an 'int*' and
 * will set the integer to 1.  This allows the following idiom:
 *
 * \code

int finished = 0;
x10rt_barrier(0, x10rt_here(), x10rt_one_setter, &finished);
while (!finished) x10rt_probe();

 * \endcode
 *
 * There is a similar function #x10rt_team_setter for team creation operations.  Note that since
 * team '0' is special, none of the team creation operations will return '0'.  This means '0' can be
 * used to initialise an #x10rt_team variable, and the completion of the operation can be detected
 * when the variable becomes non-zero.
