/** \file
 * Logical Layer.  \see \ref structure
 *
 * The API differences between the Logical Layer and the frontend of the API are as follows:
 *
 * \li Internal message types are determined by incrementing a counter, a pointer to which is
 * provided at initialization time.  All parts of the system will use this counter in order to
 * allocate message ids from the same 'pool'.
 *
 * \li In the callback registration functions, the message type is provided by the caller.  The
 * caller can tell what messages ids were reserved internally by examining the counter object that
 * was given to the Logical Layer at initialisation time, as described above.
 *
 * \li CUDA kernel processing callbacks and normal host callbacks are registered using separate
 * functions.  Note that it is possible to register both normal and CUDA callbacks for the same
 * message type.  This is because the message can be sent to either of the two places and thus
 * callbacks should be provided for both (if required).
