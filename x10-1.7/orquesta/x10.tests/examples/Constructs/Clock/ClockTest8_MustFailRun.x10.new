/**
 * Tests if we can assign a clock to an array element or
 * field.
 * Tests if clocks can be "aliased" per x10 manual terminology.
 * E.g.: clock c1 = clock.factory.clock(); clock c2 = c1;
 * //clocks c1 and c2 are "aliased"
 * ca[0] = c1; ca[1] = ca[0];
 * // ca[0] and ca[1] are "aliased"
 * The language definition needs to be cleared up, to define the behavior of this test.
 *
 * NEW SEMANTICS: Clock Use Exception such as
 *
 *  'Transmission of c (to a child) requires that I am registered with c'
 *  'Transmission of c requires that I am not between c.resume() and a next'
 *  'The immediate body of finish  can never transmit any clocks'
 *
 * are now caught at run time. The compiler
 * can remove the run time checks using static techniques,
 * and can issue warnings when it is statically detected that
 * clock use exceptions will
 * definitely occur, or will likely occur.
 *
 * Hence this file is renamed as *MustFailRun.x10
