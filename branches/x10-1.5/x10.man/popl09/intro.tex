Modern architectural advances are leading to the development of
complex computational systems, such as heterogeneous multi-core,
hardware accelerators, and large CPU-count hybrid clusters.
The \Xten{} programming language \cite{X10-concur,x10-oopsla05,X10} was
designed to address the challenge of developing
high-performance applications for such machines, building on the
productivity gains of modern object-oriented languages.

\Xten{} requires a rich type system
to enable code reuse, rule out a large variety of errors at
compile-time, and to generate efficient code.
A central
data structure in \Xten{} is the dense, distributed, multi-dimensional
array.  Arrays are defined over a set of indices known as \emph{regions},
and support arbitrary base types and accesses through {\em
points} that must lie in the underlying region. For performance it is
necessary that array accesses are
bounds-checked statically as far as possible.
Further, certain regions (such as
polyhedral regions) may be represented particularly
efficiently.  Hence, if a variable is to range only over
polyhedral regions, it is important that this information be conveyed
statically (through the type system) to the code 
generator. To support $P$-way data parallelism it is often necessary
to logically partition an array into $P$ pieces. A type system that
can establish that a given division is a partition can ensure that no
race conditions arise due to simultaneous accesses by
multiple activities to different pieces.

\subsection{Constrained types}

These requirements motivated us to develop a framework for dependent
types in object-oriented languages \cite{constrained-types}.  \emph{Dependent type
systems}~\cite{dependent-types,xi99dependent,calc-constructions}
have been extensively developed over the past few decades in the
context of logic and functional programming---they permit types to be
parametrized by \emph{values}.

The key idea behind our approach is to focus on the notion of a
\emph{constraint system}~\cite{cccc}. Constraint systems were originally developed
to provide a simple framework for a large variety of
inference systems used in programming languages, in particular as a
foundation for constraint programming languages.  Patterned after
Scott's information systems, a constraint system is
organized around the notion of \emph{constraints} or tokens of partial
information (e.g., \Xcd{X+Y>Z*3}), together with an entailment
relation $\vdash$.  Tokens may have first-order structure; existential
quantification is supported. The entailment relation is required to
support a certain set of inference rules arising from a Gentzen-style
formulation of intuitionistic logic.

In applying constraint systems to object-oriented
languages\footnote{The use of constraints for types has a
distinguished history going back to Mitchell~\cite{mitchell84}.
Our work is closely related to the \hmx{} approach
\cite{sulzmann97type}---see Section~\ref{sec:related} for
details.}, the principal insight
is that objects typically have some immutable state, and constraints on
this state are of interest to the application.  For instance, in \Java{}
the length of an array might not be statically known, but is fixed once
the array is created. Hence, we can enrich the notion of a type: for a
class \Xcd{C} we permit a \emph{constrained type} \Xcd{C\{c\}} where \Xcd{c}
is a
constraint on the immutable fields, or \emph{properties}, of the
class~\cite{constrained-types}. Thus, 
\Xcd{Array\{self.length==N\}} is a type satisfied by any array whose length
is \Xcd{N}---a (final) variable whose value may be unknown
statically. In a constraint, \Xcd{self} refers to 
a value of the base type being constrained, in this case \Xcd{Array}.
Subtyping is easily defined: a type \Xcd{C\{c\}} is a
subtype of \Xcd{D\{d\}} 
% (in the sense that any value satisfying \Xcd{C\{c\}} may be used wherever a value satisfying \Xcd{D\{d\}} is
%expected) 
provided that \Xcd{C} is a subclass of \Xcd{D} and \Xcd{c}
entails \Xcd{d} in the underlying constraint system.

Constrained types maintain a phase distinction between compile time
(entailment checking in the underlying constraint system) and run time
(computation).  Dynamic type casting is permitted---code is generated
to check at run time that the properties of the given object satisfy
the given constraint.

The constrained types approach enjoys many nice properties in contrast
to similar approaches such as DML~\cite{xi99dependent}.  Constrained
types are a natural extension to OO languages, and quite easy to
use. Constraints may also be used to specify class invariants, and
conditions on the accessibility of fields and methods (conditional
fields and methods).  Final variables in the computation can be used
directly in types; there is no need to define a separate
parallel language of index expressions to be used in the type system.
Constrained types always
permit field selection and equality at object types; hence the
programmer may specify constraints at any user-specified object type,
not just over the built-in constraint system.  

\subsection{Generic types}

In this paper we extend the constrained types approach to handle
\emph{generic
types}~\cite{clu,ada,GJ,java-popl97,thorup97,Java3,csharp-generics}---types
such as \Xcd{List<T>} in Java that are parametrized by other
types. Generic types are vital for implementing type-safe, reusable
libraries, especially collections classes. For instance, the data type
\Xcd{Array} discussed above is generic on its member type.

To permit genericity, variables \Xcd{X} must be admitted over types.
What constraints can be used to specify conditions on such variables?
In nominally typed OO languages such as \Java, the answer is
relatively clear and a simple semantic framework can be sketched out:
a type is a class \emph{name}.\footnote{This can be extended naturally
to account for interfaces.} Intuitively, an object belongs to a type
if it is an instance of the class. Types are equipped with a partial
order (the \emph{subtyping} order) generated from the user program
through the ``\Xcd{extends}'' relationship.  Further, each type is
associated with member fields and methods, each with their
name and signature.
%
%. Members are of two kinds.  A {\em
%field} has a name and an associated type. A \emph{method} has a name
%and an associated signature (the type of arguments and the return
%type).  The members available at a type and its supertype are related:
%members ``flow'' from supertypes to subtypes in a manner determined by
%the overriding rules of the language.

This motivates a very natural constraint system on types.  For a type
variable \Xcd{X} we should be able to assert the constraint \Xcd{X}
$\extends$ \Xcd{T}: a valuation (mapping from variables to types) realizes
this constraint if it maps \Xcd{X} to a type that extends \Xcd{T}.
Similarly, it should be able to require that a type has a
particular member---a field with a given name and type, or a method
with a given name and signature. We introduce the constraints 
\Xcd{T} \Xcd{has} \Xcd{f:T} and \Xcd{T} \Xcd{has} \Xcdmath{m($\tbar{x}\ty\tbar{S}$):T} to express this.

%\todo{check status of extends relation transitivity}
\eat{
The entailment relation between these pieces of partial information is
straightforward to specify, given the interpretation specified in the
previous paragraph.
For instance, the subtyping relation on class names, $\subtype$,
must be transitive and is precisely given by the transitive
closure of the extends relation, $\extends$.
}
%If the user program does not specify that a class \Xcd{C}
%extends \Xcd{D} (transitively), then \Xcd{C} does \emph{not} extend
%\Xcd{D} (closed world assumption). 
\eat{
Section~\ref{sec:O} describes the
resulting Object constraint system, $\cal O$, in more detail.
}

The next question is: where should type variables be permitted?
Clearly, one must permit methods to have type parameters (as permitted
for instance in Java~\cite{Java3}, Scala~\cite{scala}, and in
functional languages such as ML~\cite{ml} and Haskell~\cite{haskell}).
It is necessary as well to permit classes to be dependent on types---for
instance, \Xcd{Array} should be dependent on the type of its
member elements. While it is possible to develop an approach in which
classes have type \emph{parameters} \cite{Java3}, the constrained
type approach suggests an alternative: classes may have type-valued
properties. To create an instance of such
a class, a type must be supplied to initialize this property. As with
other object state, this value is available at runtime and
can hence be used in dynamic cast expressions.

A pleasing aspect of the resulting design is that the same fundamental
mechanism of constrained types---imposing constraints on properties---is
used to specify both value-dependency and type-dependency of types.
Consider the class \Xcd{Array} declared as:
{
\begin{xten}
class Array[T](r: Region) {
  def get(p: Point{self in r}): T = ...;
  def set(p: Point{self in r}, v: T) = ...;
  ...
}
\end{xten}}
\noindent The class has two properties: a type-valued property
\Xcd{T} and a value property \Xcd{r} of type \Xcd{Region}.
The \Xcd{get} method for the array requires a
point \Xcd{p} that must lie in the object's region and returns a
value of type \Xcd{T}. Within the body of
a class, class members may be referenced without using the
``\Xcd{this.}'' selector, as usual for OO languages. Hence occurrences of
\Xcd{this.r} and \Xcd{this.T} can be written \Xcd{r} and
\Xcd{T}, respectively.
Similarly, the \Xcd{set} method takes a point in the region and
a value of type \Xcd{T}.

The constrained type \Xcd{Array\{self.T==int\}} specifies the type of all
arrays
whose element type (\Xcd{T}) is \Xcd{int}.
\Xcdmath{Array\{T$\extends$Number,} \Xcd{r.rank==2\}}
specifies the type of all arrays whose base
type is a subtype of \Xcd{Number}, and whose region has rank
\Xcd{2}.
The type 
\Xcd{Array\{T==List\{length==N\},} \Xcd{r.rank==N\}}
specifies an \Xcd{N}-dimensional array whose elements are lists (of
unknown type) that are precisely \Xcd{N} long.

Note that for any expression \xcd"a" of type \xcd"Array", \xcd"a.T" is
a type, equivalent to the type to which \xcd"T" was initialized when
the object \xcd"a" was instantiated
(cf. the return type \Xcd{this.T} for \Xcd{Array.get}).
For soundness, we require
that \Xcd{a} be a final access path: an immutable
variable (including \Xcd{this}) or an access to a final field of a final access
path.

\subsection{Design and implementation of the \Xten{} type system}

Many features of modern object-oriented type systems fall out
naturally in this extended framework for constrained types.
%
We illustrate these by discussing the design of
the \Xten{} language and of various
programming idioms.

This framework forms the basis of the \Xten type system.
To make the system more usable,
the \Xten language design simplifies the type system by
restricting how constraints over type properties can be used.
We discuss these restrictions in Section~\ref{sec:discussion}.

%\todo{implementation}
%Besides constrained types, the language supports function types.
Since there may be a large number of constrained types
in a program, a pure heterogeneous translation
in which a class is instantiated multiple times on different
constraints
may lead to significant
code bloat. Instead we use a hybrid implementation scheme that
combines ideas from NextGen~\cite{nextgen,allen03} and
PolyJ~\cite{java-popl97}. The implementation supports run-time type
introspection and instantiation of generic types on primitive types.
The performance of primitive arrays, especially, is critical for the
high-performance applications for which \Xten{} is intended.  Our
design does not require that primitive values be boxed.

\subsection{The \FX{}($\cal C$) family}
To further the foundations of constrained types, we develop the \FX{}
family of languages. The core expression language is essentially
Featherweight Java (\FJ \cite{FJ}) with constrained types over
value and type constraints.
A single set of rules specifies the static and dynamic
semantics for all languages in the family.  The static semantics is
shown to be sound with respect to the operational semantics.

Different members of the family are associated with different
constraint systems. \FXZ{} is
\FX{} instantiated over the vacuous constraint system---the only
user-specifiable constraint permitted is the vacuous \Xcd{true}. \FXZ{}
corresponds to \FJ. \FXG{} permits user-specifiable subtyping
and type equality constraints; it corresponds to
\FGJ{} (being somewhat richer in permitting path types). \FXD{} permits
%and structural constraints \todo{really?}
the use of constraints from some constraint system $\cal A$ over
values; it
corresponds to a language with a pure value-dependent type system as
described in \cite{constrained-types}. Finally, \FXGD{} permits the
use of both value and type constraints,
and is the main topic of this paper.


\paragraph{Contributions.}
We extend the constrained types approach to handle generic types.  We
present the design and implementation of the type system for a
concrete language \Xten{} based on these ideas. We show how several
other ideas in OO typing (such as structural types) can also be
handled in this framework. We present a family of formal languages,
$\FX{}(\cal C)$ that capture the essence of the idea of constrained
types. By appropriately choosing $\cal C$, one can get languages that
support simple types, just value-dependent types, just type-dependent
types, and both. We establish the soundness of the type system for all
members of the family.
