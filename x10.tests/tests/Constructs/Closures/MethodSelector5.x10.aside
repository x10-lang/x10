/**
 * For a type T, a list of types (T1, . . . , Tn), a method name m and an
 * expression e of type T, e.m.(T1, . . ., Tn) denotes the function, if
 * any, bound to the instance method named m at type T whose argument
 * type is (T1, . . ., Tn), with this the method body bound to
 * the value obtained by evaluating e. The return type of the function is
 * specified in the method declaration.  Thus, the method selector
 * 
 * e.m.[X1, . . ., Xm](T1, . . ., Tn)
 * 
 * behaves as if it were the closure
 * 
 * (X1, . . ., Xm](x1: T1, . . ., xn: Tn) => e.m[X1, . . ., Xm](x1, . . ., xn)
