X10 ensures that every variable must have a value consistent with its type
before it is read.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For local variables, this is ensured by using a pre-specified static
analysis to ensure that every local variable is written into before it
is read. Type-checking of assignment ensures the value written is
consistent with the static type of the variable.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For fields, this is ensured by introducing a form of ownership types
called <em>incomplete types</em> to address the <em>escaping-this</em>
problem.  To permit flexibility in writing constructors, X10 v1.7
permits "this" to be used in a constructor as a reference to the
object currently being constructed. Unfortunately there are no
restrictions on the usage of "this". In particular, this reference
can be permitted to escape: it may be stored in variables on the heap
(thereby permitting concurrently executing activities to read the
value of fields that may not yet have been initialized), passed as an
argument to method invocations, or used as the target for a method
invocation. Indeed, the method may be invoked in a super constructor,
and may have been overridden at a subclass, guaranteeing that accesses
to fields defined in the subclass are accesses to uninitialized
variables. For instance an immutable field may be observed containing
a value (the value the field was initialized with) which may be
different from the value it will contain once the constructor has
returned.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Incomplete types are designed with the following goals:
 
<ul>
<li> Guarantee that fields are read only after they are initialized.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li>  Allow the creation of immutable cyclic object graphs.<a href="#tthFtNtAAB" name="tthFrefAAB"><sup>1</sup></a>  This requires that it be possible to pass an
  object under construction into a constructor invocation.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> Allow appropriate user-defined methods can be called during object
  creation (so that the transformation between the values supplied as
  parameters to a constructor and the values actually placed in fields
  is determined by arbitrary user-defined code).
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> Keep the design minimally invasive. Most programmers should
  not have to be concerned about this problem.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> Ensure that there is no runtime overhead.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
These goals are met by introducing incomplete types through the type
qualifier "proto". Types of the form "proto T" are said to be
<em>incomplete types</em>; types that do not have the qualifier are said to be
<em>complete</em>.
 Say that an object &#246;" is <em>confined</em>
to a given activity &#196;" if it can be reached only from stack
frames of &#196;" or from objects which are, recursively, confined to
&#196;". Thus confined objects cannot be accessed by activities other
than &#196;".

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Incomplete types ensure that objects whose construtors have not exited
are confined. Further, all references to such objects on the stack
are contained in variables of incomplete types. The compiler does not
permit the fields of variables of incomplete types to be read. 
Thus incomplete types permit the construction of graphs of objects
while ensuring that these objects are confined and their fields are not
read during construction. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The return value of a constructor for class "C" that takes no
incomplete arguments is (a subtype of) "C", that is, a complete
type. It will point only to completed objects. It can now be
assigned to any (type-consistent) field of any object, that is, it is
now allowed to escape.

      <h4><a name="tth_sEc4.0.1">
4.0.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;"proto" Rules</h4>
<a name="protorules">
</a>
<a name="ProtoRules">
</a>


<div class="p"><!----></div>
For every type "T" (where "T" is not a type variable), we
introduce the type "proto T". 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There is no relationship between types "T" and "proto T" -
neither is a subtype of the other.<a href="#tthFtNtAAC" name="tthFrefAAC"><sup>2</sup></a>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Incomplete types are permitted to occur only as types of method
parameters or local variables or as return types for methods and
constructors. They may not occur in (the source or target of) cast
statements, &#235;xtends" or &#239;mplements" clauses, "catch"
clauses, or as types of class fields.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Within the body of a class "C" the type of "this" in
constructors, instance initializers and instance variable initializers
is "proto C".

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Let "v" be a value of type "proto C", for some class "C". 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
No fields of "v" can be read.  (This is the defining property of
"proto" types.)  However, "v''s (accessible) instance fields
can be assigned.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"v" can be assigned to an instance field &#246;.f" only if "f"
is of some type "S" such that "T &lt;: S" and &#246;" has an
incomplete type.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"v" can be assigned to local variables  only if they are of some type
"proto S" (such that "T &lt;: S").

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Instance methods of class "C" may be qualified with "proto"
(these methods are called <em>incomplete methods</em>). The type of "this"
in incomplete methods is "proto C". Incomplete methods can be
overridden only by incomplete methods.  Only incomplete methods can be
invoked on "v". Incomplete methods which do not take an argument of incomplete
type can be invoked on completed values. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"v" can be passed as argument into a constructor or method call,
or returned from a method.  The return type of a method taking an
argument at an incomplete type must be "void" or incomplete.  The
return type of a constructor taking an argument at a "proto" type
must be incomplete.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
A generic class (method) type parameter "T" can be
  instantiated with the type "proto S" (where "S" is not a type
  parameter itself), provided that the class (method) body satisfies
  the conditions above for "proto S".

<div class="p"><!----></div>
During code generation, the type "proto T" is treated as if it were
"T". That is, there is no run-time cost to "proto" types.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The invariants maintained by the design are as follows.  Say that an
object field or stack variable (local variable) contains an incomplete
value if a value of type "proto T" (for some "T") was written
into it.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<ul>
<li> If an object &#246;" has a field containing an incomplete value "v",
then either "v''s constructor has exited or &#246;" is confined.
Further, every reference to &#246;" on the stack is held at an incomplete type.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> If a stack variable contains an incomplete value, then
  the variable's type is incomplete.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Say that a constructor invocation for a class "C" on the call
stack is a <em>root</em> if it takes no incomplete arguments. Such a
constructor invocation will return an object of type "C" whose
fields may point to an arbitrary graph of newly created objects
(objects created by the activity after the constructor
invocation). Since the object returned is at type "C" - and not
"proto C" - It may be assigned to any field of any object on the
heap of type "D" such that "C &lt;: D".  It is no longer
confined. Thus the "magic moment" when an incomplete value becomes
complete is when the last constructor for any incomplete value it
references (including itself) returns.

      <h4><a name="tth_sEc4.0.2">
4.0.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Example</h4>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This example shows how to create a fixed-size circular buffer.
(Its pointer structure is immutable, though the contents of each
field are mutable.)

<pre>
class  CircularBuffer[A] {
  var a: A;
  val next: CircularBuffer[A];
  private def this(x: proto CircularBuffer[A]): proto CircularBuffer[A] {
    next = x;
  }
  def this(var n:Int) {
    var temp: proto CircularBuffer[A] = this;
    while (-n &#62; 0) 
    temp = new CircularBuffer[A](temp);
    next = temp;
  }
}
</pre>
