1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Overview</h2>
The runtime entities in X10 are of three kinds: <em>structs</em>,
<em>objects</em>, and <em>functions</em>. This section is concerned with
functions and their types - how they are created, and what operations
can be performed on them.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Intuitively, a function is a piece of code which can be applied to a
set of arguments to produce a value. The application may not
terminate, or may terminate abruptly. Functions may throw checked and
unchecked exceptions. The body of a function may be any X10
expression: hence a function evaluation may spawn multiple activities,
read and write mutable locations, wait until memory locations contain
a desired value, and execute over multiple places. In particular,
function evaluation may be non-deterministic. When applied to the same
input twice, a function may yield two different results.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It is a limitation of X10 v2.0 that functions do not support
type arguments. This limitation may be removed in future versions of
the language.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
A <em>function literal</em> "(x1:T1,..,xn:Tn){c}:T=&#62;e" creates a
function of type "(x1:T1,...,xn:Tn){c}:T"
(&#167;). The body &#235;" of such an expression is
type-checked in an environment in which "c" is true. At runtime,
function execution results in the evaluation of &#235;" in an
environment in which each formal is bound to the given actual
parameter.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The <em>method selector expression</em> &#235;.m.(x1:T1,...,xn:Tn)" (&#167;)
permits the specification of the function underlying
the method "m", which takes arguments of type "(x1:T1,..., xn:Tn)".
Within this function, "this" is bound to the result of evaluating &#235;".

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Function types may be used in &#239;mplements" clauses of class
definitions. Instances of such classes may be used as functions of the
given type.  Indeed, an object may behave like any (fixed) number of
functions, since the class it is an instance of may implement any
(fixed) number of function types.
