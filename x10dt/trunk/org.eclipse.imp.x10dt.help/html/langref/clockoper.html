 <h2><a name="tth_sEc1">
1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Clock operations</h2><a name="sec:clock">
</a>
The special statements introduced for clock operations are listed below.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
  :  |        <em>  
<table>
<tr><td align="right">Statement &nbsp;ClockedStatement </td></tr>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Note that "x10.lang.Clock" provides several useful methods on
clocks (e.g. "drop").

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc1.1">
1.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating new clocks</h3><a name="sec:clock:create">
</a>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Clocks are created using a factory method on "x10.lang.Clock":

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<pre>
timeSynchronizer: Clock = Clock.make();
</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The current activity is automatically registered with the newly
created clock.  It may deregister using the "drop" method on
clocks (see the documentation of "x10.lang.Clock"). All activities
are automatically deregistered from all clocks they are registered
with on termination (normal or abrupt).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc1.2">
1.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Registering new activities on clocks</h3>
<a name="sec:clock:register">
</a>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The programmer may specify which clocks a new activity is to be
registered with using the "clocked" clause.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
An activity may transmit only those clocks that is registered with and
has not quiesced on (&#167;). 
A "ClockUseException" is
thrown if (and when) this condition is violated.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
An activity may check that it is registered on a clock "c" by
executing:
<pre>
c.registered()
</pre>
 This call returns the "Boolean" value "true" iff the
activity is registered on "c"; otherwise it returns "false".

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 Note:
X10 does not contain a "register" statement that would allow an
activity to discover a clock in a datastructure and register itself on
it. Therefore, while clocks may be stored in a datastructure by one
activity and read from that by another, the new activity cannot
"use" the clock unless it is already registered with it.


<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc1.3">
1.3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Resuming clocks</h3><a name="resume">
</a><a name="sec:clock:resume">
</a>
X10 permits <em>split phase</em> clocks. An activity may wish
to indicate that it has completed whatever work it wishes to perform
in the current phase of a  clock "c" it is registered with, without
suspending all activity. It may do so  by executing the method
invocation:
<pre>
c.resume();
</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
An activity may invoke this method only on a clock it is registered
with, and has not yet dropped (&#167;). A "ClockUseException" is thrown if (and
when) this condition is violated.  Nothing happens if the activity has
already invoked a "resume" on this clock in the current phase.
Otherwise execution of this statement indicates that the activity will
not transmit "c" to an &#228;sync" (through a "clocked"
clause),
until it terminates, drops "c" or executes a "next". 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 S<font size="-2">TATIC</font> S<font size="-2">EMANTICS</font> R<font size="-2">ULE</font>:
The compiler should issue an error if any activity has a potentially
live execution path from a "resume" statement on a clock "c"
to a
async spawn statement (which registers the new
activity on "c") unless the path goes through a "next"
statement. (A "c.drop()" following a "c.resume()" is legal,
as is "c.resume()" following a "c.resume()".)


<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc1.4">
1.4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Advancing clocks</h3><a name="sec:clock:next">
</a>
An activity may execute the statement
<pre>
next;
</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 Execution of this statement blocks until all the clocks that the
activity is registered with (if any) have advanced. (The activity
implicitly issues a "resume" on all clocks it is registered
with before suspending.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
An X10 computation is said to be <em>quiescent</em> on a clock
"c" if each activity registered with "c" has resumed "c".
Note that once a computation is quiescent on "c", it will remain
quiescent on "c" forever (unless the system takes some action),
since no other activity can become registered with "c".  That is,
quiescence on a clock is a <em>stable property</em>.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Once the implementation has detected quiescence on "c", the system
marks all activities registered with "c" as being able to progress
on "c". An activity blocked on "next" resumes execution once
it is marked for progress by all the clocks it is registered with.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc1.5">
1.5</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Dropping clocks</h3><a name="sec:clock:drop">
</a>
An activity may drop a clock by executing:
<pre>
c.drop();
</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 The activity is no longer considered registered with this
clock.  A "ClockUseException" is thrown if the activity has
already dropped "c".
