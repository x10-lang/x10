 <h1>Developing/Editing your X10 project</h1>
<p>The features described here are mostly independent of the type of X10 project (Java or C++ back-end).
</p>

<h2 id="edit">Editing the X10 source code</h2>
<p>The Eclipse editor has many features to help you conveniently edit your X10 source.
To open the editor on a source file, double-click on the file in the Package Explorer view.
<br><img src="images/editFile.png">
</p>
<p>Syntax highlighting highlights X10 code depending on the different language features.
For example, comments are one color, quoted strings in another, X10 keywords in another color, etc. 
<br><img src="images/editor.png">
</p>
<p><b>Outline: </b>
The Outline view, to the right of the editor view, shows the parts of the file. Expand the "Hello" class name in the Outline view
to show the sub-parts.  Select anything in this view to have the editor navigate to its location
and highlight what you have selected.
<br><img src="images/outlineView.png">
</p>
<p><b>Formatting: </b> as you type in the editor, and hit Enter/Return, the X10 editor attempts to
indent the next line at the "proper" level.
For more information on setting your preferences that control how X10 code is formatted, see
<a href="prefs.html#format">Preferences for formatting</a>.
</p>
<p><b>Content Assist:</b> methods appropriate to an object can be listed easily.
Type an object, a dot, then hit Control-space.  A list of appropriate method calls is provided in a  pop-up.
Use the cursor or mouse to select one.  As you continue typing, the list responds to possible completions that
match what you have typed.  
<br/>For <b>more information</b> on content assist and code templates, 
see <a href="ContentAssist.html">Content Assist features in X10DT</a>
to save typing in the X10DT editor.

</p>
 
<p><b>Hover Help: </b> Hover over an X10 method or class name with the mouse to show a yellow pop-up of information about that item.
If there is javadoc-style ("X10doc") comment information, that will be shown.
<br><img src="images/editHoverHelp.png">
</p>
<p>There are many other features of the Eclipse editor that we won't describe here.
But here is just one: for example, to turn on line numbering, right-click on the grey <i>marker bar</i> 
at the left editor the editor and select "Show Line Numbers."
<br><img src="images/lineNum1.png">
</p>
<p>You'll see the line numbers at the left edge of the editor.
<br><img src="images/lineNum2.png">
</p>

<h2 id="error">Errors in your code</h2>
<p>If there are errors in your code, you will see red error markers at the left edge of the offending line.
For example, remove the semicolon from the end of the last line in main().
</p>
<p>Even before you save the file to re-compile it, you will see the error appear.
You can tell in this figure that the editor buffer has not been saved because the
filename, on the editor tab, is preceded by an asterisk(*).
<br><img src="images/errorMarker.png">
</p>
<p>
Hover over the error marker with your cursor to see the reason for the error.
<br><img src="images/errorMarkerHover.png">
</p>
<p>If you save the file to cause a compile, or otherwise build your application,
any compile errors will also show up in the Problems view.  
The Problems View is below the editor, but it's probably not shown by default.
Click on its tab, which is visible with its title "Problems," to bring it forward.
<br><img src="images/errorMarkerProblems.png">
</p>
<p>You can double-click on any item in the Problems view and the editor will
highlight that line in the source file. (Note: some items, such as Warnings, may be on Java files.
Java files  are generated by the X10 compiler from the X10 source files.  So if you click 
on one of these you might end up in a strange java file!  You can usually safely ignore these.)
</p>
<p><b>Note: </b> If your X10 source file does not compile correctly when you save it (See "Building" below), then some editor
features may not work correctly.
</p>

<h2 id = "building">Building</h2>
<p>By default, each time you save the file, the X10 compiler builds it automatically.</p> 
<p>To turn off this behavior, you
can select Project > Build Automatically to uncheck this item.
<br><img src="images/buildAutoMenu.png">
</p>
<p>Then, if you have turned off "Build Automatically," you will need to explicitly ask X10DT
to build your project.  First, make sure you have saved your source file.
Then to build, select Project > Build Project 
to rebuild the current project.
<br><img src="images/buildAutoMenu2.png">
</p>
<p>But "Build Automatically," which causes building on each save, is typical behavior - try it, you may find you like it.
</p>
<p>If you want to see a console of what happens when it builds, see
<a href="prefs.html#echo">X10 Preferences</a> and the option in Compiler Preferences to "Echo compile arguments to console".
