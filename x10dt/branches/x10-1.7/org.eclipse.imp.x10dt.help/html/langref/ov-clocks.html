4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Clocks</h2>
The MPI style of coordinating the activity of multiple processes with
a single barrier is not suitable for the dynamic network of (possibly
diverse) activities in an  X10 computation. Instead, it becomes
necessary to allow a computation to use multiple barriers.  X10
<em>clocks</em> () are designed to offer the
functionality of multiple barriers in a dynamic context while still
supporting determinate, deadlock-free parallel computation.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Activities may use clocks to repeatedly detect quiescence of arbitrary
programmer-specified, data-dependent set of activities. Each activity
is spawned with a known set of clocks and may dynamically create new
clocks. At any given time an activity is <em>registered</em> with zero or
more clocks. It may register newly created activities with a clock,
un-register itself with a clock, suspend on a clock or require that a
statement (possibly involving execution of new async activities) be
executed to completion before the clock can advance.  At any given
step of the execution a clock is in a given phase. It advances to the
next phase only when all its registered activities have <em>quiesced</em>
(by executing a "next" operation on the clock).
When a clock advances, all its activities may now resume execution.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Thus clocks act as <em>barriers</em> for a dynamically varying collection
of activities. They generalize the barriers found in MPI style program
in that an activity may use multiple clocks simultaneously. Yet
programs using clocks are guaranteed not to suffer from
deadlock.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<em>In future versions of the language,
clocks will be integrated into the  X10 type system,
permitting variables to be declared so that they are final in each
phase of a clock.</em>
