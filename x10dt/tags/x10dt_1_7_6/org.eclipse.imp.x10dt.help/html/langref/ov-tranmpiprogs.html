7</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Translating MPI programs to  X10</h2>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
While  X10 permits considerably greater flexibility in writing
distributed programs and data structures than MPI, it is instructive
to examine how to translate MPI programs to  X10.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Each separate MPI process can be translated into an  X10
place. Async activities may be used to read and write variables
located at different processes. A single clock may be used for barrier
synchronization between multiple MPI processes.  X10 collective
operations may be used to implement MPI collective operations.
 X10 is more general than MPI in (a)&nbsp;not requiring synchronization
between two processes in order to enable one to read and write the
other's values, (b)&nbsp;permitting the use of high-level atomic blocks
within a process to obtain mutual exclusion between multiple
activities running in the same node (c)&nbsp;permitting the use of multiple
clocks to combine the expression of different physics (e.g.,
computations modeling blood coagulation together with computations
involving the flow of blood), (d)&nbsp;not requiring an SPMD style of
computation.
