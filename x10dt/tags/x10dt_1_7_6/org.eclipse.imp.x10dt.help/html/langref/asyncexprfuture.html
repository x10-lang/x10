5</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Asynchronous Expression and Futures</h2><a name="XtenFutures">
</a>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 X10 provides syntactic support for <em>asynchronous expressions</em>, also
known as futures:
<pre>
511   Primary ::= FutureExpression
515   FutureExpression ::= 
        future PlaceExpressionSingleListopt 
            Expression 
</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Intuitively such an expression evaluates its body asynchronously at
the given place. The resulting value may be obtained from the future
returned by this expression, by using the <tt>force</tt> operation.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In more detail, in an expression <tt>future(Q)e</tt>, the place
expression <tt>Q</tt> is treated as in an <tt>async</tt> statement. <tt>e</tt>
is an expression of some type <tt>T</tt>. <tt>e</tt> may reference only
those variables in the enclosing lexical environment which are
declared to be <tt>final</tt>.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If the type of <tt>e</tt> is <tt>T</tt> then the type of
<tt>future (Q)e</tt> is <tt>future&lt;T&#62;</tt>.  This 
type <tt>future&lt;T&#62;</tt> is defined as if by:
<pre>
public interface future&lt;T&#62; {
  T force();
  boolean forced();
}
</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(Here we use the syntax for generic classes.  X10 v1.01 does not support
generic classes in their full generality. In particular, the user may
not define generic classes. This is reserved for future extensions to the
language.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Evaluation of <tt>future (Q)e</tt> terminates locally with the creation
of a value <tt>f</tt> of type <tt>future&lt;T&#62;</tt>.  This value may be
stored in objects, passed as arguments to methods, returned from
method invocation etc. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
At any point, the method <tt>forced</tt> may be invoked on <tt>f</tt>. This
method returns without blocking, with the value <tt>true</tt> if the
asynchronous evaluation of <tt>e</tt> has terminated globally and with
the value <tt>false</tt> if it has not.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The method invocation <tt>force</tt> on <tt>f</tt> blocks until the
asynchronous evaluation of <tt>e</tt> has terminated globally. If the
evaluation terminates successfully with value <tt>v</tt>, then the method
invocation returns <tt>v</tt>. If the evaluation terminates abruptly with
exception <tt>z</tt>, then the method throws exception <tt>z</tt>. Multiple
invocations of <tt>force</tt> (by this or any other activity) do not
result in multiple evaluations of <tt>e</tt>. The results of the first
evaluation are stored in the future <tt>f</tt> and used to respond to all
<tt>force</tt> queries.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<pre>
future&lt;T&#62; promise 
     = future (a.distribution[3]) { a[3] };
T value = promise.force();
</pre>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc5.1">
5.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Implementation notes</h3>
Futures are provided in  X10 for convenience; they may be
programmed using latches, <tt>async</tt> and <tt>finish</tt> as
described in &#167;&nbsp;7.6.3.
