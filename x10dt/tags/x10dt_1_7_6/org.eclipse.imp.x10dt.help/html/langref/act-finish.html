</a>
The statement "finish S" converts global termination to local
termination and introduces a root activity. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<em>  
<table>
<tr><td align="right">Statement &nbsp;::=&nbsp; FinishStatement </td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">FinishStatement &nbsp;::=&nbsp; <tt>finish</tt> Statement </td></tr>
<tr><td align="right"></td></tr></table>
</em>


<div class="p"><!----></div>
An activity A executes "finish S" by executing "S".  The
execution of "S" may spawn other asynchronous activities (here or
at other places).  Uncaught exceptions thrown or propagated by any
activity spawned by "S" are accumulated at "finish S".
"finish S" terminates locally when all activities spawned by "S"
terminate globally (either abruptly or normally). If
"S" terminates normally, then "finish S" terminates normally
and A continues execution with the next statement after "finish S".
If "S" terminates abruptly, then "finish S"
terminates abruptly and throws a single exception formed 
from the collection of exceptions accumulated at "finish S".

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Thus a "finish S" statement serves as a collection point for
uncaught exceptions generated during the execution of "S".

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Note that repeatedly "finish&#239;ng a statement has no effect after
the first "finish": "finish finish S" is indistinguishable
from "finish S".

<b>Interaction with clocks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><a name="sec:finish:clock-rule">
</a>
"finish S" interacts with clocks (). 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
While executing "S", an activity must not spawn any "clocked"
asyncs. (Asyncs spawned during the execution of "S" may spawn
clocked asyncs.) A
"ClockUseException" is thrown
if (and when) this condition is violated.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In  X10 v1.7 this condition is checked dynamically; future
versions of the language will introduce type qualifiers which permit
this condition to be checked statically.
