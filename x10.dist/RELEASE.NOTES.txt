Release 2.1.1

This release includes both the C++ and Java backends and runtimes.

Method names "apply(I)" and "set(v,I)" are no longer special.  They
have been replaced by "operator this(I)" and "operator this(I)=(v)"
(note the change in parameter order).

"..", "->", and "in" are now all user-overloadable operators.
The precedence of ".." has been bumped up to be tighter than that of
"*", so 0..10*0..10 now works, but 0..N-1 does not.
All code must be updated to use 0..(N-1) instead.

To support more effective optimization, a change was made to 
x10.array.Array and x10.array.Region to define rail as a standalone
property instead of as a conjunction of rank==1,zeroBased,rect.
If you have code that has type declarations of the form:
  a:Array[T]{rail}
you will need to add an explicit rank==1 by saying:
  a:Array[T](1){rail}

The typedef of Void to void was removed from the standard library and
void is now defined to be a keyword instead of a type.  
All code must be updated to replace all uses of Void with void.

The custom serialization protocol was changed to use a distinguished
type (x10.io.SerialData) instead of x10.lang.Any.

Please consult the language specification for the details of
these changes and for a list of additional changes.

The following features described in the 2.1.1 language manual do not
currently work and will be fixed in the subsequent releases:
  - Non-static type definitions as class or interface members
    (static type defs do work)
  - Type definitions as package members (i.e., in the outermost scope of
    a compilation unit)

The constraint solver used by X10 typechecker is known to be incomplete 
for situations in which a constraint implies an infinite number of 
distinct constraints.

Additionally, the following features described in the language
manual do not currently work with the C++ backend and will be fixed in
the subsequent releases:
  - Garbage collection on AIX
  - Non-final generic instance methods
  - Exception stack traces on Cygwin

The generated C++ code requires g++ 4.2 or better to be compiled; 
we do almost all of our testing against g++ 4.3.2.  On AIX, you
may either use g++ 4.2 or better or xlC 10.1.0.4 or better.
