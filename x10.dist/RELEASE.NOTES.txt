Release 2.2.2

MAJOR CHANGES

No major changes have been made to the language specification 
in this release.  The following major changes have been made to the
implementation and the class libraries.

  + X10 now requires a Java 6.0 SDK as the minimum Java version
    to build X10.  Previous versions of X10 would work on either 
    Java 5.0 or Java 6.0.
  + Starting with X10 2.2.2, the compiler/runtime system will optimize
    the pattern 
        at (P) async S; 
    into a more efficient remote async invocation for any P. The pattern 
        async at (p) S;
     will only be optimized into a more efficient remote async invocation 
     when p is a simple expression (eg local variable reference).  
     Therefore we recomment using at (P) async S where possible.
     All code in the X10 standard library and benchmarks has been updated.

Please consult the language specification for the details of
any minor language changes and specification clarifications made in
this release.

LIMITATIONS OF THIS RELEASE

The following features described in the 2.2.2 language manual do not
currently work and will be fixed in the subsequent releases:
  - Non-static type definitions as class or interface members
    (static type defs do work)

The constraint solver used by X10 typechecker is known to be incomplete 
for situations in which a constraint implies an infinite number of 
distinct constraints.

Additionally, the following features described in the language
manual do not currently work with the C++ backend and will be fixed in
the subsequent releases:
  - Garbage collection on AIX
  - Non-final generic instance methods
  - Exception stack traces on Cygwin

As in previous releases, the X10 runtime uses a "busy wait" loop
in the worker threads that execute asyncs. A consequence of this is
that even if a place has no asyncs to execute, it will still consume
CPU cycles busy waiting for new asyncs to be created.  
See XTENLANG-1012 for more details.

The generated C++ code requires g++ 4.2 or better to be compiled; 
we do almost all of our testing against g++ 4.3.2.  On AIX, you
may either use g++ 4.2 or better or xlC 10.1.0.4 or better.
