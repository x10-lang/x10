Release 2.0.3

This release includes both the C++ and Java code generation backends.

The following significant language changes were made since the 2.0.2 release:
- To simplify the initial development of X10 programs, we have enhanced the 
  compiler to automatically insert dynamic checks when it is unable to
  statically verify that type constraints of an invoked method are satisfied. 
  The most obvious manifestation of this feature is with place types, where the 
  compiler will automatically insert a dynamic place check when a non-global method
  is being invoked on a receiver object that is not known statically to be in 
  the current place.
  By default, the compiler will insert the dynamic checks and report a summary
  of the total number of such checks inserted in each file compiled.
  Two command line arguments are available to modify this behavior:
    -VERBOSE_CALLS : print the details of each dynamic check that is inserted
    -STRONG_CALLS : do not insert dynamic checks and instead treat non-entailment 
          as a compilation error (the default behavior of X10 2.0.2).
  The intent is that programmers will initially develop with the default settings,
  but as the code matures, -VERBOSE_CALLS can be used to reduce the number of dynamic
  checks and in production-level code, -STRONG_CALLS can be used to take full 
  advantage of the static type systems ability to verify static properties of the code.

- There have been significant design changes and performance improvements in the
  x10.array class library.
    -- Array, Dist, Region, and Point have all been moved into the x10.array package.
    -- The x10.array package is imported by default (same as x10.lang).
    -- We have separated single place and multi-place arrays. 
       x10.array.Array is a local (single place) array.
       x10.array.DistArray is a distributed (multi-place) array.
    -- x10.array.Array is defined over a Region and no longer has a Dist.
    -- x10.array.DistArray continues to have a Dist.
    -- Enhancements to the compiler and to the structure of the Array implementation
       have significantly improved the performance of Array.
    -- We have removed some of the more complex Dist and Region operations.
       In X10 2.0.4 (early June) we will be focusing on improving the performance
       of DistArray.  In X10 2.1.0 (late July) we will be bringing back 
       higher performance versions of additional Dist and Region operations.

For details on these and other more minor changes, please consult the
language specification included in the X10 release.

The following features described in the 2.0 language manual do not
currently work and will be fixed in the subsequent releases:

- Non-static type definitions as class or interface members
  (static type defs do work)
- Type definitions as package members (i.e., in the outermost scope of
  a compilation unit)
- AST externalization to XML
- Shared local variables
- Extern methods

Additionally, the following features described in the language
manual do not currently work with the C++ backend and will be fixed in
the subsequent releases:

- Garbage collection on AIX
- Generic virtual methods
- Exception stack traces on Cygwin and AIX

The generated C++ code requires g++ 4.2 or better to be compiled; 
we do almost all of our testing against g++ 4.3.2.  On AIX, you
may either use g++ 4.2 or better or xlC 10.01.0000.0004 or better.
