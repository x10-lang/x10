X10 Release 2.5.0.5

This is a minor release of X10 with the following changes from X10 2.5.0.4
  + The JavaSockets transport no longer closes the listen port when running
    with a single place.  This allows future places to join.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

X10 Release 2.5.0.4

This is a minor release of X10 with the following changes from X10 2.5.0.3
  + Added X10_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT environment variable (default=30s), which
    specifies how long to wait before new place connections timeout
  + Improvements to elastic X10 when multiple places join or die concurrently
  + Fix for XTENLANG-3465, related to detecting a dead place in resilient X10
  + Better handling when the user provides invalid hostnames

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

X10 Release 2.5.0.3

This is a minor release of X10 with the following changes from X10 2.5.0.2
  + Fix to prevent a possible deadlock in a newly joined place when it first
    starts up.
  + Added a zipfile of the generated .java files that come from .x10 files 
    under stdlib, if needed for future reference.
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

X10 Release 2.5.0.2

This is a minor release of X10 with the following changes from X10 2.5.0.1
  + Fix to catch exceptions thrown when deserializing and running closures 
    at the JavaSockets layer, preventing a lockup of the worker thread.
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

X10 Release 2.5.0.1

This is a minor release of X10 with the following changes from X10 2.5.0.
  + XTENLANG-3437: Experimental Java MPI launcher causes SEGV with non-IBM Java VM 
  + XTENLANG-3438: GC library and build system patch for K computer
  + Addition of NamedMessage annotation for controlling name of generated
    closure class in Managed X10
  + Addition of a new mode to OSGi-serialization support in Managed X10.
  + fixes to the packageRPM.sh script to work with latest version of rpmbuild.

X10 Release 2.5.0 Release Notes

HIGHLIGHTS OF THIS RELEASE

X10 Release 2.5.0 includes a redesign of several X10 standard library
APIs to better support Resilient and Elastic X10.  In particular, we
have rethought various aspects of Place-related functionality to more
naturally support execution over a dynamically varying set of
Places. For all the details, please see the X10Doc for x10.lang.Place,
x10.lang.PlaceGroup, and x10.lang.PlaceTopology. 
Some of the key changes are:
  + The removal of static constants such as PlaceGroup.WORLD,
    and Place.MAX_PLACES. They are replaced by Place.places()
    and Place.numPlaces() which return values that represent
    the current view on the dynamically changeable set of Places
    available to the computation.
  + The removal of iteration functionality (next/prev) from Place.
    This functionality is now provided only through PlaceGroup.
  + The addition of PlaceTopology to provide a more flexible set of
    APIs describing the topological relationships of Places.

X10 2.5.0 also includes a set of enabling runtime system changes to
better support the embedding of X10 and the XRX runtime into larger
programs written in other programming languages.  These changes are
surfaced to the programmer via a new set of APIs on x10.lang.Runtime
that support initializing the XRX runtime, submitting jobs for
execution by the XRX runtime, job cancellation, and runtime shutdown. 

A backwards incompatible change to the x10.util.Map interface removes
the usage of x10.util.Box on the return value of the put and get
methods of Map by requiring that Values stored in Map satisfy the
haszero constraint (XTENLANG-573).  This may require adjustment in
application code that uses implementation of x10.util.Map. 

For additional information about Resilient and Elastic X10, please see
samples/resiliency and the x10-lang.org website.

LIMITATIONS OF THIS RELEASE

The size and index of arrays must be less than 2^31 with Managed X10.
An attempt to allocate a longer array causes IllegalArgumentException. 

The following features described in the 2.5 language manual do not
currently work and may be fixed in the subsequent releases:
  - Non-static type definitions as class or interface members
    (static type defs do work)

The constraint solver used by X10 typechecker is known to be incomplete 
for situations in which a constraint implies an infinite number of 
distinct constraints.

Additionally, the following features described in the language
manual do not currently work with Native X10.
  - Non-final generic instance methods
  - Exception stack traces on Cygwin

The generated C++ code requires g++ 4.2 or better to be compiled; 
we do almost all of our testing against g++ 4.4.
  + On Power/Linux and BG/Q, you may either use g++ 4.2 or better
    or xlC 11.1 or better.
