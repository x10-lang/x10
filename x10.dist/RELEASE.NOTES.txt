Release 2.0.4

This release includes both the C++ and Java code generation backends.

There has been a very significant improvement in the performance of
the code generated by the Java backend.  Since 2.0.3 performance of 
an X10 port of the jBYTEmark benchmarks has improved by 10x.

The standalone (single machine) version of X10RT now supports
multi-place execution by setting the environment variable
X10RT_STANDALONE_NUMPLACES to indicate the number of places
that should be used  to run the program.  A separate process 
will be created for each place and they will communicate via 
shared memory.

No significant language changes were made since the 2.0.3 release.
For details on any minor language changes, please consult the
language specification included in the X10 release.

The following features described in the 2.0 language manual do not
currently work and will be fixed in the subsequent releases:

- Non-static type definitions as class or interface members
  (static type defs do work)
- Type definitions as package members (i.e., in the outermost scope of
  a compilation unit)
- AST externalization to XML
- Shared local variables
- Extern methods

Additionally, the following features described in the language
manual do not currently work with the C++ backend and will be fixed in
the subsequent releases:

- Garbage collection on AIX
- Generic virtual methods
- Exception stack traces on Cygwin and AIX

The generated C++ code requires g++ 4.2 or better to be compiled; 
we do almost all of our testing against g++ 4.3.2.  On AIX, you
may either use g++ 4.2 or better or xlC 10.01.0000.0004 or better.

Below is a summary of JIRA issues addressed for the X10 2.0.4 release.
