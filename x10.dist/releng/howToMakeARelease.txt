Notes on how to make an X10 Release.

A number of artifacts are produced as part of making an X10 release.
The main artifacts are:

   1. Binary releases of the PGAS runtime (hosted on codehaus) 
      for each supported OS/hardware target.
   2. A source release of X10.
   3. A source release of the X10 test suite.
   4. A source release of the X10 benchmarks.
   5. Binary platform-dependent releases that contain both the Java 
      and C++ backend and runtimes for each supported OS/hardware target.
   6. PDF of the X10 language specification

The following is the procedure used to make a release of X10.
Before creating the release branch (typically the day before)

   1. Update the version information in x10.compiler/src/x10/Version.java

   2. Update the plugin manifest version in all MANIFEST.MF files in 
      X10 core projects

   3. Copy the current set of PGAS binaries found in the svn head sub dir of
      http://dist.codehaus.org/x10/binaryReleases/ to a new subdirectory
      named with the release number and change
      x10.runtime/src-cpp/x10rt/pgas/pgas.mk to pull from the release
      directory. The easiest way to move the files around is with cadaver (a
      command line tool with similar interface to sftp).

      mkdir junk
      cadaver https://dav.codehaus.org/dist/x10/binaryReleases/svn%20head
      <login>
      mget *timestamp*
      cd ../<release-dir>
      mput *timestamp*

Create the release branch and enter into final testing phase

   1. "Tag" the release by using x10.dist/releng/makeTag.sh 
      Use a svn revision number that matches one reported by a 
      night-sanity run. i.e.

      makeTag -rev 12500 -tag SF_RELEASE_2_0_1 -code 

   2. Create an RC2V2 instance from image pok1img-9700.0 to run release-branch 
      regression testing.
      Login as x10reg, and update scripts in bin to pull from the 
      release branch created by makeTag. 
      Enable crontab entry for desired test runs.

   3. If fixes need to be applied to the release after it is created, apply 
      fixes to head first. After they pass regression testing on head, 
      pull them over to the release branch using

        svn merge -c <change revision> ^/trunk

When all necessary fixes have been propagated to the release branch,
one can build the actual release artifacts:

   1. Update JIRA version management to indicate that version has been released.

   2. Edit and commit release notes to the trunk. Release notes can be
      mostly generated from JIRA.  Use svn merge to get the release
      notes from the trunk to the release branch.

   3. run masterBuildRelease.sh to build tarballs for most platforms 
      and push them to orquesta.  You will need to run this script from a
      machine where you have passwordless ssh working to all relevant machines.

      masterBuildRelease.sh -version 2.0.1 -tag SF_RELEASE_2_0_1

      To build the BGP release on bgpfen1, you will need to manually checkout
      and build a release branch and then use packageRelease.sh.  This
      is due to restricted network connectivity from the front-end machine.

   4. ssh into shell.sf.net and create a subdirectory of 
      /home/frs/project/x/x1/x10 to hold the downloads. 
      Use sftp to move all of the release artifacts from orquesta to sf.
      Rename RELEASE_NOTES.txt to README.txt in the sf download area
      Use SF web admin API to set the default downloads for each OS 
      platform to the new files

   5. ssh into shell.sf.net and create a subdirectory of 
      /home/frs/project/x/x1/x10dt to hold the downloads. 
      Use sftp to move all of the release artifacts from orquesta to sf.

   6. ssh into shell.sf.net and create a subdirectory of 
      /home/project-web/x10/htdocs/x10dt to hold the x10dt update site.
      create an updateSite subdir of the new directory and unzip the
      update site zip from the download section into it.

   7. Make sure language manual has the right version, date, etc. 
      Tag the language manual

        makeTag -rev 12500 -tag SF_RELEASE_2_0_1 -man

      Put language spec pdf in project web space at x10.sourceforge.net
      Update in place x10-latest.pdf in addition to creating a 
      x10-<version>.pdf. 
      The release page itself will point to the x10-<version>.pdf. 
      All of the other parts of the website refer to x10-latest.pdf.

   8. Generate new x10doc and upload to project web space at x10.sourceforge.net
      update the "latest" sym link to point to the new directory.

   9. Create a release page for the new release on the web site.  
      Update the "X10 Releases" page to link to the new download version.
      Update the "latest release" menu item in Downloads-submenu to point to the new release page.

   10. Post release announcement in SF news and web page front-page news.

   11. Send out mail announcements to x10-users and x10-announce
