We distinguish between proper and improperly nested frames (= tasks = Cilk's procedure invocation). 
A properly nested frame f is one
whose body pushes a frame onto the dequeue only when it transfers control to the frame. This
guarantees that when f's compute method returns the frame at the bottom of the dequeue is f.
Therefore a simple w.popStackFrame() is adequate to get rid of the (now useless) frame. 

An improperly nested frame g will have a compute method that may push frames without transfering
control to them. Hence at the moment when control returns from g's method, it may not be the case
that the last frame on the dequeue is g. Therefore a call to popStackFrame() at the end of
g's compute method would be incorrect. Instead, the compute method returns, leaving the frame on the
stack. Now the worker, as usual, invokes the compute method on the frame at the bottom of the dequeue
(g). We ensure that g's compute method contains code at the beginning which checks whether the 
frame has aready been executed (e.g. by looking at the vaue of the PC). If so, the frame is popped.

This piece of code is in any case necessary because g may get stolen while the victim is executing it. 
For, g's compute method may push another frame onto its dequeue, thereby making g eligible for theft,
according to the rules of the work stealing implementation. We permit g to be stolen; however, since
its PC records the fact that another worker is executing its body (PC==1), the victim simply
pushes it onto its stack and then pops it.

There is a negative interaction between the mechanism for stealing and the
mechanism for executing frames left behind on the stack (for globallyQuiescent computations).

For a frame or closure to be stolen it must be the case that the victim has at least two 
frames on its cache's stack. The upper frame is the one that will be stolen, 
the lower frame is the one that the victim is currently working on. 

Therefore, when the victim enters the mode in which it is executing the frames on the cache's
dequeue one by one, it cannot simply pop the element of the stack. It must execute the current
frame without popping it. When it succeeds in executing this frame, then it must pop the frame.

Work stealing notes.
version 2
Vijay Saraswat

TODO
 -- Does not completely capture abort execution paths.

These notes are based on reading the Cilk manual, the source code for
Cilk (5.4.3) and the Cilk papers.

Basic design principle

* Work-first -- ensure that there are as few overheads as possible on
  the fast path. The fast path corresponds to the path used by a
  depth-first sequential execution of the source program. Move
  overhead to code paths that are executed only when there is a steal.

Definitions:

* Thread: A thread is a maximal sequence of instructions in the body
  of a method terminated by the end of the method or a spawn or a sync.

* Worker: the underlying computation engine that actually executes
  code, e.g. an operating system thread. A computation will have
  multiple workers.

* Thief: worker who steals a piece of work from another worker.

* Victim: A worker that gives up work to a thief.

Assumptions:

* Every method is compiled into a slow and a fast version. If there is
  no steal during execution, only fast methods will execute. The body
  of each slow method only invokes fast methods. A slow method is
  invoked only by a thief, who does it implicitly when resuming a
  stolen frame.

Each worker maintains a *deque* of closures implemented as a doubly
linked list.

Each closure contains a *frame stack* (containing *frames*),
represented as an array with three pointers:

  -- H (head): the index of the first (non-stolen) frame on the stack.
  -- T (tail): 1+the last valid index at which a frame is stored in the stack.
  -- E (exception): 

Invariants: 
   H <= T
   H <= E

Victim reads E, and reads/writes H and T. Thief writes E and reads T.

The frame stack contains *frames*. A frame contains values of local
variables within a method activation, a PC that specifies the next
instruction in the body of the method after the current thread, and a
function pointer to the slow method.

A closure also contains a reference to the worker that owns it.  Each
closure contains a lock.  It also a contains a field, result, of the
type of the closure.

INITIATION OF COMPUTATION

p workers are created. Some worker is given a job to execute
(cilk_main). This invokes the required function in fast mode. 


FAST MODE EXECUTION

o spawn: If this is the first spawn in the body of the method, create
  a frame and push it on frame stack for the thread. i.e. 

  stack[T] = new Frame();

  Update the current frame thus: 

   -- PC gets the value of the first instruction in the body of the
      method after the code sequence corresponding to the body of the spawn. 

   -- Copy (trail) the values of all live local variables (that have
      been modified since the last time they were trailed) into the
      current frame.

   -- On weak architectures (e.g. PPC), introduce a StoreStore barrier.

   -- Increment the pointer (T++). The StoreStore barrier will ensure
      that the writes to the variables in the current frame are
      visible before T is incremented. (In Java, T should be declared
      volatile.)

  Thus if this frame were stolen, the thief will have enough
  information to allow execution to continue after this spawn (in slow
  mode).

  Now descend into the spawn through a method call. 

o Return from spawn:

  We assume that the spawn is of the form:

    x = spawn ...

  i.e. the return value is written into a local variable. (More
  complicated expressions involving spawn are converted into
  invocations of "inlet functions".)

  Check whether the parent frame has been stolen. 
    --T; 
    StoreLoadBarrier; // implied in Java if T (and E?) is volatile
    if (E >= T) 
       // Now stolen 
    else 
       // Not stolen.

  This is done by one-half of Dekker (the variable T is written, and
  the variable E is read). Note that E may be non-zero but less than
  T. This reflects the fact that a higher ancestor has been stolen. (No
  special processing needs to be done in this case.)

  If the parent is stolen, fast-mode computuation must cease
  immediately. Call the exception handler, which: 

    -- Locks the deque. 
       This ensures that the thief has finished promoting and left a
       closure behind at the top of the deque. 

       Why? As discussed below the thief grabs the deque before it
       attempts to steal, hence it is guaranteed to steal the closure
       on the victim's deque and leave behind a promoted closure for
       the victim to deal with, before the victim gets this lock.

    -- Extracts the closure t at the bottom of the deque.
    -- Locks t.
    -- Polls inlets on t. (See below.)
    -- Resets exception pointer: E=H
    -- Asserts that closure is RUNNING or RETURNING. 
    -- Marks t as RETURNING.
       Note that there is still some work to be done, but it will be
       done by the scheduler after the call stack has been unwound
       (see a few steps below).

    -- Copy return value into t.return_value. 
    -- Unlock t.
    -- Unlock the deque.
    -- Return a default value from this method. This will result in
       the call stack unwinding immediately, since the
       return-from-spawn processing will be done recursively and on
       each return the condition E >= T will be true (note that as the
       frame stack is popped T will decrease).

    Note that this path involves grabbing locks. However, this does
    not compromise the work-first principle since this cost can be
    charged to the (successful) steal, i.e. this cost would not have
    been incurred unless there was a succesful steal.

o Sync (join):

   In fast mode, if the worker gets to a sync point it can simply
   continue since it knows that it has finished executing all the
   children. i.e. a sync is a no-op.

o Steal:
  -- Select victim (randomly choose a victim worker).
  -- Grab the victim's deque lock to lock out any other thief.
  -- Check if the victim has a closure at the top of the deque.
  -- If not, bail, no stealing to do.
  -- If so, grab the closure lock and continue.
  -- Check that victim has work to steal. The closure at the top of
     the victim's stack must be in RUNNING state.
  -- Execute thief portion of Dekker:
      E++;              // lockstate: closure, deque
      memory barrier;  // lockstate: closure, deque
      if (H+1 < T)     // lockstate: closure, deque
         // thief wins, there is at least one child frame on the stack.
         // i.e. there are at least two frames on the stack.
         // the topmost frame will be stolen.
         // the one below that will be left behind.
         Promote child // lockstate: closure, deque
         Detach parent // lockstate: closure, deque
         unlock deque  // lockstate: closure
         Finish promoting child //lockstate: closure
         unlock closure // lockstate: empty
      else {
         // thief loses, retract exception
        E--;            // lockstate: closure, deque
        unlock closure  // lockstate:  deque
        unlock deque    // lockstate: empty
      }
   -- If a closure was stolen, go to AFTER A STEAL below.
   -- Otherwise, yield if time slice was set. 
   -- Repeat while not done.

Promote child: (done while holding closure and deque locks)
   -- Create a new closure, c.
   --  c.parent = parent; 
       c.joinCounter=0; 
       c.cache = parent.cache;
       c.status = RUNNING
       c.frame = frames in the parent, less the topmost frame (which
       is now stolen)
   --  Add closure to the bottom of the victim's deque. 

Finish promote child: (done while holding closure lock)
   -- parent.joinCounter++;
   -- add child to list of incomplete inlets of parent.
   -- parent.status = READY
   -- parent.cache is invalidated.

AFTER A STEAL

Once a closure is stolen, the thief must determine what to do with
it. (do_what_it_says).

  -- Lock the closure.
  -- Case on the status.
  -- If closure is READY
     -- if it is being aborted, abort it and unlock the closure.
     -- else execute it:
        -- setup for execution
        -- poll inlets
        -- unlock closure. (Required by protocol.)
        -- lock the dequeue
        -- add the closure to the bottom of the deque.
        -- unlock the deque
        -- Now start executing the compute method of this closure (see below).
  -- If closure is RETURNING
     -- Unlock closure.
     -- Now deposit the return value of the closure in the appropriate place:
        -- Go to the closure's parent.
        -- Now the child is in no deque and unlocked. The child is still
           in the children list of the parent. The parent's lock can now be 
           grabbed.
       -- Lock the parent closure p.
       -- Assert that the parent's status is not RETURNING. // lock: p
       -- Remove the child from the incomplete inlets list of the parent.
       -- Lock the child c. // lock: p,c
       -- Complete and enque the inlet: // lock: p,c
          -- copy the child's return value into the inlet arg
          -- add the inlet to list of completed inlets.
       -- If parent status is RUNNING // lock: p,c
            -- signal immediate exception to parent, i.e. set E to infinity.
          else poll inlets yourself.
       -- Cilk fence ?!?!?
       -- decrement parent counter
       -- Cilk fence
       -- Provably good steal:  
          If parent has no children, and parent is SUSPENDED, poll the
          parent's inlets, set its cache to null (because the closure
          is being stolen and the cache is worker-specific?), set its
          status to READY, and return the parent for execution (else
          return null).
       -- Unlock parent
       -- Unlock child
       -- Destroy child

poll inlets:

  Walk the completed inlets and apply them. (The incomplete inlets are
  ignored.)

  The default inlet simply copies the returned value (argument of
  inlet) into the i'th slot in the frame (where the inlet specifies
  the index i).

SLOW MODE EXECUTION

Slow mode corresponds to the execution of the body of a method

   public void compute() { ...}

on a closure. Slow versions of procedures are created only on steals,
hence they are always on top of the stack frame.

The slow version of a procedure is invoked from the scheduler, and
hence through a standard interface. In Cilk, the arguments are passed
in a frame (the only argument to the procedure). In Java, the slow
version of the procedure is a method (compute) on the object, and the
arguments are available as fields on the object.

The return value of the procedure must be stored in the result field
of the closure. 

The slow version of the procedure differs from the fast version in
that since it may have outstanding children, it may suspend at a
sync. How this is done is discussed below.

The compute method works as follows. It uses the value of PC (a field
on the closure) to determine which label to jump to and start
execution. Note that this label may be in the middle of a loop. So
Duff's device is necessary to make this work. This is going to be
difficult to do in Java, so the Java programmer will need to write
appropriately convoluted code to get the desired
effect. Alternatively, the X10 compiler can directly produce class
files with the appropriate gotos embedded in the body of the method.

Similarly the other local variables are restored from their copy in
the frame. Now everything is set up for computation to resume at the
first instruction after the spawn during the execution of which this
frame was stolen from the victim.

Spawn:

 A spawn is executed in the body of a slow mode procedure in exactly
the way in which is it executed in the body of a fast mode procedure,
except that no new frame needs to be created since a frame is already
on the stack of the worker.

Return from spawn:

 On a return from a spawn exactly the same processing must be
performed as in the fast mode. For, the parent frame may have been
stolen while the worker was busy in the child frame. (Thieves can have
their pockets picked as well!)

Return from slow mode: (Cilk_set_result)

 -- Lock the deque.
 -- Lock the closure at the bottom of the deque.
 -- Assert that the closure is RUNNING.
 -- Mark the closure as RETURNING.
 -- Copy the result into the return field.
 -- Unlock the closure.
 -- Unlock the queue.

Sync:

 The processing at a synchronization point is different. The worker
 needs to check if any children are still outsanding. It does this by
 checking the value of joinCounter. If this is greater than zero, this
 closure is marked as suspending, and removed from the queue. (Further
 processing on this closure will be performed by the last returning
 child.) The method returns to the scheduler, which will now look for
 work to steal since its deque is empty. (Recall that a slow mode
 procedure is always on top of the stack.)

 -- Lock the deque
 -- Lock the closure at the bottom of the deque.
 -- Assert closure is RUNNING.
 -- Assert closure is at the top of the deque.
 -- Poll inlets.
 -- Assert that the closure is still at the bottom of the deque.
 -- If hasChildren() (there is a need to suspend):
      Mark the closure as SUSPENDED. Remove it from the deque.
 -- Unlock closure.
 -- Unlock deque
 -- Return whether or not there is a need to suspend.

SCHEDULER

Here is the top level loop (Cilk_scheduler) for a worker:

   -- While not done repeat:
   -- Try to get work from the local deque.
      -- Lock the deque. 
      -- Extract the bottom closure into t
      -- Unlock the deque.
   -- If that did not work, steal using a random choice of victim.
      -- If this succeeds, it will return a closure.
   -- Do what it says on the closure (do_what_it_says) see above.

Why is it possible that the worker will find a closure on the local
deque? Because this closure may be a child closure promoted because
its parent was stolen or it may be a stolen closure (so the top-level
call was a slow call). 

In the first case, the theft will cause the C-stack for the fast call
to unwind. This will ultimately cause control to return into the body
of this function (do_what_it_says returns). Now as it goes around its
loop, the scheduler will find the promoted child closure on the local
deque. This closure will be in RETURNING state, and the invocation of
do_what_it_says on this closure will cause the value to be moved to
the inlet and the inlet to be marked as completed.

The second case is similar. The slow call will return. The result
value will be in the closure on the bottom of the deque. The worker
will pick it up and push it to the parent.

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

The fast path introduces the following overhead over sequential
execution:

  -- Procedure's frame needs to be allocated, initialized, pushed onto
     the deque. Claim: half a dozen assembly instructions?
  -- Procedure's state needs to be saved before each spawn (writes of
     local dirty variables + PC, plus a StoreLoad barrier).
  -- Procedure must check if its frame has been stolen after each
     return from a spawn. Requires two reads, compare, branch and a 
     StoreLoad barrier. 
  -- On return, frame must be freed. A few assembly instructions?
  -- An extra variable is needed to hold the frame pointer. Increased
     register pressure.

Cilk folks claim that the Cilk Fib on one processor (hence no steals)
runs only 3 times slower than sequential Fib. This is very
impressive. Note that Fib is the worst possible case for Cilk since
its thread length is very small.

On the other hand when there is a steal:

  -- The victim's C call stack must be popped all the way to the top
     (through returns).

  -- Victim locks deque, closure (may be contention/delays in getting
     both), copies result bytes into closure, goes around the
     scheduling loop once, locks the deque again to pick up the
     closure, executes it to move the value from the closure to the
     inlet. To do that it has to lock the parent closure and the
     child, and may end up executing a provably good steal of the
     parent.

  -- Thief has to find a victim (this may take a few failed thief
     attempts), grab the deque lock, execute Dekker (write, read,
     branch) and succeed, move parent closure, promote child, install
     it in an inlet of the parent.

     Thief has to continue the call in slow mode. Any sync
     will be a slow sync (this locks the deque and the closure, polls
     inlets, checks if there are children).

     Finally, return from slow mode has the same overhead as return in
     fast mode after a steal.
  
==============
Notes:

-- The original call is a fast mode call.
-- setup_for_execution copies the worker's cache into the closure.

TODO

-- Can a deque ever contain more than one closure? A victim may
   certainly have many frames stolen from it before it detects
   that. e.g. it may have n+1 frames on its stack, and the top n may
   get stolen. The victim will discover its loss only when it returns
   from a frame and discovers its parent frame has been stolen. At
   this point there will be no frame in the current closure.
