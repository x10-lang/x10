/// MESSAGING LAYER ///


01) Initialization & Termination
--------------------------------


Init
----

Purpose: Initializes the X10 Runtime System.

Library: libx10.a

C++ syntax:

#include <x10/x10lib.h>
int x10lib::Init(handlers, n)
	x10_async_handler_t *handlers;
	int n;

C syntax:

#include <x10/x10lib.h>
int x10_init(handlers, n)
	x10_async_handler_t *handlers;
	int n;

Parameters:

	INPUT
	handlers	Specifies a set of handlers that needs to be registered for
				remote async execution.
	n			The number of handlers that need to be registered.

Description:

	Initializes data structures needed for communication as well as registers
	handler addresses into an internal handler table, if handlers argument is
	not NULL and n is > 0.
	This method/function must be called before placing any other X10Lib calls.

Return values:

	X10_OK		Indicates the method/function call completed successfully.
	X10_ERR_LAPI	Unable to create the LAPI context for communication.


Finalize

C syntax:

#include <x10/x10lib.h>
int x10_finalize()

Description:

	This method/function must be called after using X10Lib calls.
	It is an error when any X10Lib calls are made after this routine is called.
	Internally, it terminates and cleans up the LAPI context used for communication.

Return values:
	X10_OK		Indicates the method/function call completed successfully.
	X10_ERR_LAPI	Unable to destroy the underlying LAPI context.

06) Ordering
------------

Fence
-----

Purpose: Enforce local order on X10Lib calls.

Library: libx10.a

C++ syntax:

#include <x10/x10lib.h>
int x10lib::Fence()

C syntax:

#include <x10/x10lib.h>
int x10_fence()

Description:

	Blocks the calling task until all the X10Lib operations initiated by
	the task before the fence are guaranteed to complete at the destination.

Return values:

	X10_OK		Indicates the method/function call completed successfully.
	X10_ERR_LAPI	Error from the underlying communication system.

Gfence
------

Purpose: Enforce global order on X10Lib calls.

Library: libx10.a

C++ syntax:

#include <x10/x10lib.h>
int x10lib::Gfence()

C syntax:

#include <x10/x10lib.h>
int x10_gfence()

Description:

	Blocks the calling task until all the outstanding X10Lib operations initiated
	before the fence are guaranteed to complete regardless of the destination.
	This is a collective call that enforces order across all tasks and provides
	barrier synchronization among them. The call guarantees that only the
        data movement is complete, but not the operations on remote side. 

Return values:

	X10_OK		Indicates the method/function call completed successfully.
	X10_ERR_LAPI	Error from the underlying communication system.

Note:
    
      The current gfence implementation assumes that only one thread executes per
      place. This precludes both multipile asyncs per place as well as execution
      in INTERRUPT mode.  Thus, the only mode of operation for LAPI is POLLING mode.
      Under these conditions, the following invariants hold:
      1. Only one thread (except shared memory thread) executes.
      2. Gfence guarantees that all the data sent out before Gfence are acknowledged.
      3. The async methods are completed inline in the header handler or the inline completion handler.
      These imply that successful return of Gfence is a guarantee that all the remote operations 
      completed. 

Finish
------

FinishBegin
------------

Purpose: Block the calling process until it receives the continue signal from process 0.

Library: libx10.a

C++ syntax:
#include <x10/x10lib.h>
int x10lib::finishStart (int cs)

C syntax:
 This is a C++ only feature.

Description:

  Blocks the calling process until it receives the 
  continue signal from the parent process (process 0).
  The call returns the received continue signal back to
  the calling process.

Parameters:

  INPUT
  cs    The continue signal. The parent process will send the next jump point
        to the child processes. The child processese should wait to receive them.
  
Return values:

       0 or -1          Indicates the calling process should
                     simply wait for the CS from task 0.

       > 0           Indicates the calling processs should jump
                     to the corresponding jump point in the program 
                     after the call returns. 
                    
FinishEnd
==========

Purpose:  Block the root process (process 0) until all the processes
          have reached this call. Also, collect the exception from the processes.

C++ syntax:
#include <x10/x10lib.h>
error_t x10lib::finishEnd (ex)
  Exception* ex;    

C syntax:
 This is a C++ only feature.

Description:

  Blocks the parent process (process 0) until it receives the exception signal
  and exception value from the children. 

Parameters:
  INPUT
  ex         The exception thrown by the processes. 
  
Return values:

  X10_OK		Indicates the method/function call completed successfully.
  X10_ERR_LAPI		Error from the underlying communication system.

Exceptions:
  
  Throws MutltiException in process 0
     
Note:
   The following sequence is equivalent to a Gfence:
   finishEnd();
   process 0 code with no async spawns;
   finishBegin();

09) Active messages
-------------------

Purpose: Execute an user specified method on the remote task.

Library: libx10.a

C++ syntax:

error_t 
x10lib::asyncSpawnInline (dest, handler, n, args);
error_t
x10lib::asyncSpawnInline (dest, handler, arg0);
error_t
x10lib::asyncSpawnInline (dest, handler, arg0, arg1);
	place_t dest;
        async_handler_t handler;
        int n;
        async_arg_t* args;
        async_arg_t arg0;
        async_arg_t arg1;

Parameters:

	INPUT
	dest	Specifies the remote node id.
	n	Specifies the number of arguments to the remote method routine.
        handler Specifies the remote method by a unique constant number. It is
                the users responsibility to create this unique number for every
                remote method.
        args    Specifies an array of arguments. For simplicity, different version
                of asyncSpawnInline that take different number of remote method
                arguments are defined.

Description:

	Use this method/function to execute another method in remote node. The 
        function just passes the handler to the remote node and invokes
        the user defined function asyncSwitch, which has the following
        prototype.
     
        error_t asyncSwitch (async_handler_t handler, async_arg_t* args, int niter);

        The body of the asyncSwitch should invoke the remote method corresponding to
        the handler and repeat it niter times. For non-aggregate asyncs, niter is 1.
        asyncSwitch should be declared in the user program. Typically, the body of
        asyncSwitch is of the following from:

        error_t 
        asyncSwitch (async_handler_t handler, async_arg_t* args, int niter) 
        {
          for (int i = 0; i < niter; i ++)
            switch (handler) {
              case 0 : 
                async0 (*args++);
                break;
              case 1 :
                async1 (*args++, *args++)
                break;
              ....
            }
        }

Return values:

	X10_OK		Indicates the method/function call completed successfully.
	X10_ERR_LAPI	Error from the underlying communication system.

Note:
    
Aggregation:
-----------

Purpose:  Enqueue the active messages and execute them as an aggregate
	  on the remote task. The size of the aggregate is fixed by the library.  
          Once the aggregation limit is reached, the active messages are sent
          to the destination and executed there.

Library: libx10.a

C++ Syntax:

error_t 
x10lib::asyncSpawnInlineAgg (dest, handler, n, args);
error_t
x10lib::asyncSpawnInlineAgg (dest, handler, arg0);
error_t
x10lib::asyncSpawnInlineAgg (dest, handler, arg0, arg1);
	place_t dest;
        async_handler_t handler;
        int n;
        async_arg_t* args;
        async_arg_t arg0;
        async_arg_t arg1;

Parameters:

	INPUT
	dest	Specifies the remote node id.
	n	Specifies the number of arguments to the remote method routine.
        handler Specifies the remote method by a unique constant number. It is
                the users responsibility to create this unique number for every
                remote method.
        args    Specifies an array of arguments. For simplicity, different version
                of asyncSpawnInlineAgg that take different number of remote method
                arguments are defined.

Description:

          The requirements are the same as asyncSpawnInline. Users should define asyncSwitch in his program.

Return values:

	X10_OK		Indicates the method/function call completed successfully.
	X10_ERR_LAPI	Error from the underlying communication system.

Flush
-----
Purpose : Flush all the outstanding aggregated active messages. 

C++ Syntax:

error_t 
x10lib::asyncflush (handle, n)
        async_handler_t handle;
        int n;

Parameters:
  
        INPUT

        handle  Specifies the handle of the active message to be flushed.
                It is solely the user's responsibility to provide the same
                handle as that used by asyncSpawnInlineAgg. Failure to do so
                will lead to un-predictable results.
	n	Specifies the number of arguments to the  remote method.

Description:

	Use this method/function to flush all the outstanding aggregated active messages.
        Typically, a call to a flush is performed before Gfence(). 

Return values:

	X10_OK		Indicates the method/function call completed successfully.
	X10_ERR_LAPI	Error from the underlying communication system.
