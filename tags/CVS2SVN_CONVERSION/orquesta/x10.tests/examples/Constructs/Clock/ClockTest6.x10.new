/**
 * Clock test for multiple clocks.
 * Testing semantics of next with multiple clocks.
 *
 * For a clock c: I cannot advance to my next phase
 * until all activities registered with me have executed
 * resume on me for the current phase,
 * and all activities scheduled for completion
 * in my current phase (with now(c)) have globally finished.
 *
 * My phase zero starts when I am declared/created.
 *
 * For an activity a: My next cannot advance to the
 * following statement, until all clocks
 * that I am currently registered with have advanced to
 * their next phase.
 *
 * next will do an implicit resume first on each of the clocks
 * I am registered with.
 *
 * I get registered with a clock c by creating/declaring c,
 * or by being enclosed in a clocked(...,c,...) statement.
 *
 * I can register a child activity of mine with some of the clocks
 * I am already registered with by
 * async(P) clocked(c1,..,cn) S
 *
 * I can post a child activity for global completion during the
 * current phase of some of the clocks I am registered with,
 * by now(c1,...,cn) S
 *
 * I can deregister with the clocks I am registered with, by terminating
 *
 * Expected result of this test: should not deadlock
 * and should not throw Error
 *
 * Like ClockTest5, but
 * when the parent terminates, it is as if
 * it executed a next on the clocks it is still registered with.
 * Children should be able to proceed with their next statements
 * after the parent terminates.
 *
 * This test uses multiple clocks but also uses a common
 * clock for all activities. The common clock forces
 * the next to behave like ordinary lock-step barriers (not
 * guaranteed in general, see ClockTest15).
